<h1>The Official Go SDK</h1>

<p>
Currently, the tools in the official Go SDK are the most used tools to develop Go projects.
In Go 101 article series, all examples are compiled and verified with the official Go compiler.
</p>

<p>
This article will introduce how to setup the Go development environment
and how to run simple Go programs.
Some tools provided in the official Go SDK will also be introduced.
</p>

<h3>Install Go SDK</h3>

<p>
Please <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">download</a> the official Go SDK
and install it according the instructions at the same page.
</p>

<p>
The version of an official Go SDK release is consistent with
the highest Go language verison the release supports.
For example, Go SDK 1.9.x supports all Go versions from 1.0 to Go 1.9.
</p>

<p>
The path to the <code>bin</code> subfolder in the Go SDK installation root path
must be put in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to execute the tools in the SDK.
</p>

<p><i>
(Before Go SDK 1.9, a <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable must be configured
as the root path of the SDK installation.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.9#goroot">Since Go SDK 1.9</a>,
this environment variable becomes optional and is recommended not to set it.)
</i></p>

<p>
Before Go SDK 1.8, a <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable must be set.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.8#gopath">Since Go SDK 1.8</a>,
the default value of this environment variable is the path of the <code>go</code>
folder under the home directory of the current user.
If you don't like the default <code>GOPATH</code>,
you still can specify it manually.
The <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable can contain multiple paths.
</p>

<p>
The <code>bin</code> subfolder in the first path specified in
the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable is highly recommended
to be put in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to run
some third-party Go programs.
The <code>go install</code> command will put
the result executables in the <code>bin</code> folder
(below will introduce all kinds of <code>go</code> sub-commands).
</p>

<p>
Up to Go 1.9, the official Go SDK recommends all of
your Go packages are put
in the <code>src</code> subfolder in any path specified
in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable,
especially when a Go project depends on some third party packages.
However, all examples in Go 101 series are very simple so that
you can put the example files in any folder.
Packages will be introduced in the
<a href="packages-and-imports.html">packages and imports</a> article.
</p>

<h3>The Simplest Go Program</h3>

<div>
<p>
Let's write a simple exmaple and learn how to run simple Go programs.
</p>

The following program is the simplest Go program.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The words <code>package</code> and <code>func</code> are two keywords.
The two <code>main</code> words are two identifiers.
Keywords and identifiers are introduced in
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html">the next article</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first line <code>package main</code> specifies the package name
(<b>main</b> here) of the soruce file.
</p>

<p>
The second line is a blank line, to make the code get a better readability.
</p>

<p>
The remaining code declares a function
which is also called <b>main</b>.
We can think the main function in the main package
of a program specifies the entry point of the program,
though there would be some other user code getting executed
before the main function in Go.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Run Go Programs</h3>

<div>

<p>
The official Go SDK requires that every Go source code file
must ends with a <code>.go</code> extension.
Here, we assume the above source code saved in a file
named <code>simplest-go-program.go</code>.
</p>

<p>
Open a terminal and change the current directory to the directory
which contains the above source file, then run
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run simplest-go-program.go
</code></pre>

<p>
Nothing is output? Yes, this program does nothing.
</p>

<p>
If there are some syntax errors in the source code,
then there would be some compile errors reported.
</p>

<p>
Mote. if there are multiple source files
in the <code>main</code> package of a program,
then we should run the program with the following command
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run *.go
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Note, the <code>go run</code> command is not recommended
to compile and run large Go projects.
It is just a convenient way to run simple Go programs,
just like the ones in the Go 101 article series.
For large Go projects,
the <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code>
commands should be used instead.
</p>

<h3>More <code>go</code> Subcommands</h3>

<p>
The three commands, <code>go run</code>, <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code>,
will only show code syntax errors if they fail.
They don't show code warnings (a.k.a, possible code logic errors).
We can use <code>go vet</code> command to check and report such warnings.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go fmt</code> command to format Go source code
with a consistent coding style.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go get</code> command to clone and checkout
a remote third-party go package repository.
<code>go get</code> requires the corresponding version control tool must be installed.
If the command successes, the third-party go package will be put in
the <code>src</code> folder under the first path specified
in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p>
The <code>go test</code> command is used to run tests and benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go doc</code> command to view Go documentations.
</p>

<p>
You can run <code>go</code> command without any arguments to
show what subcommands are supported.
</p>

<p>
The Go 101 article series will not explain much more on how to use the tools
provided by the official Go SDK.
Please read the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">official documentations</a> for details.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="doc"></p>
<h3>View Go Documentations</h3>

<p>
We can view all kinds of Go documentations at the official Go
website <a href="https://golang.org">golang.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
We can also run <code>godoc -http=:9999</code> to start a local clone of the
official website at <a href="http://localhost:9999">localhost:9999</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please notes, currently (v1.9), if the <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable is not configured,
we must specify the <code>goroot</code> flag when running the local godoc server.
For example, <code>godoc -http=:9999 -goroot path/to/go/sdk</code>.
