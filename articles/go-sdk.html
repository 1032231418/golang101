<h1>The Official Go SDK</h1>

<p>
Currently, the tools in the official Go SDK are the most used tools to develop Go projects.
In Go 101 article series, all examples are compiled and verified with the standard Go compiler.
</p>

<p>
This article will introduce how to setup the Go development environment
and how to run simple Go programs.
Some tools of the official Go SDK will also be introduced.
</p>

<h3>Install Go SDK</h3>

<p>
Please <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">download</a> the official Go SDK
and install it according the instructions at the same page.
</p>

<p>
The version of an official Go SDK release is consistent with
the highest Go language verison the release supports.
For example, Go SDK 1.10.x supports all Go versions from 1.0 to Go 1.10.
</p>

<p>
The path to the <code>bin</code> subfolder in the Go SDK installation root path
must be put in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to execute the tools in the SDK.
</p>

<p><i>
(Before Go SDK 1.9, a <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable had to be configured
as the root path of the SDK installation.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.9#goroot">With Go SDK 1.9</a>,
this environment variable became optional, and it is recommended to leave it unset.)
</i></p>

<p>
Before Go SDK 1.8, a <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable must be set.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.8#gopath">Since Go SDK 1.8</a>,
the default value of this environment variable is the path of the <code>go</code>
folder under the home directory of the current user.
You may specify <code>GOPATH</code> manually in order work with one (ore more) different location(s),
an the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable may list multiple paths.
</p>

<p>
It is highly recommended to add the <code>bin</code> subfolder of the very first path specified in
the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable as this allows to run
some third-party Go programs
duw to the <code>go install</code> command putting
any resulting executables into this <code>bin</code> subfolder of the first path.
</p>

<p>
The official Go SDK recommends to put all
your Go packages
into the <code>src</code> subfolder of any path specified
in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable,
especially when a Go project depends on some third party packages.
However, all examples in Go 101 articles are very simple so that
the example files can be put in any folder.
Packages will be introduced in the
<a href="packages-and-imports.html">packages and imports</a> article.
</p>

<h3>The Simplest Go Program</h3>

<div>
<p>
Let's write a simple exmaple and learn how to run simple Go programs.
</p>

The following program is the simplest Go program.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The words <code>package</code> and <code>func</code> are two keywords.
The two <code>main</code> words are two identifiers,
and <b>main</b> is a special predefined identifier.
Keywords and identifiers are introduced in
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html">a coming article</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first line <code>package main</code> specifies the package name
(<b>main</b> here) of the soruce file.
</p>

<p>
The second line is a blank line for better readability.
</p>

<p>
The remaining code declares a function
which is also called <b>main</b>.
This <b>main</b> function in a <b>main</b> package
specifies the entry point of a program.
(Note that some other user code might be executed
before the <code>main</code> function becomes invoked.)
</p>

</div>

<h3>Run a Go Program</h3>

<div>

<p>
The official Go SDK requires that Go source code file
to have the extension <code>.go</code>.
Here, we assume the above source code is saved in a file
named <code>simplest-go-program.go</code>.
</p>

<p>
Open a terminal and change the current directory to the directory
which contains the above source file, then run
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run simplest-go-program.go
</code></pre>

<p>
Nothing is output? Yes, this program outputs nothing.
</p>

<p>
If there are some syntax errors in the source code,
then there would be some compile errors reported.
</p>

<p>
Note: If multiple source files are
in the <code>main</code> package of a program,
then we should run the program with the following command
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run *.go
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Note, the <code>go run</code> command is not recommended
to compile and run large Go projects.
It is just a convenient way to run simple Go programs,
just like the ones in the Go 101 articles.
For large Go projects
use the commands <code>go build</code> or <code>go install</code>
instead.
</p>

<h3>More <code>go</code> Subcommands</h3>

<p>
The three commands, <code>go run</code>, <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code>,
will only show code syntax errors (if any).
They don't (try to) show code warnings (a.k.a, possible code logic mistakes).
We can use the <code>go vet</code> command to check and report such warnings.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go fmt</code> command to format Go source code
with a consistent coding style.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go get</code> command to clone and checkout
a remote third-party go package repository.
<code>go get</code> requires the corresponding version control tool must be installed.
If the command succeeds, the third-party go package will be put in
the <code>src</code> folder under the first path specified
in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go test</code> command to run tests and benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go doc</code> command to view Go documentations.
</p>

<p>
The <code>go</code> command run without any arguments
shows the supported subcommands.
</p>

<p>
The Go 101 article series will not explain much more on how to use the tools
provided by the official Go SDK.
Please read the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">official documentations</a> for details.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="doc"></p>
<h3>View Go Documentations</h3>

<p>
We can view all kinds of Go documentations at the official Go
website <a href="https://golang.org">golang.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
We can also run <code>godoc -http=:9999</code> to start a local clone of the
official website at <a href="http://localhost:9999">localhost:9999</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please note that currently (v1.10), if the <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable is set,
we must specify the <code>goroot</code> flag when running the local godoc server,
e. g. <code>godoc -http=:9999 -goroot path/to/go/sdk</code>.
This inconvenience may be caused by a bug which may be fixed later.
