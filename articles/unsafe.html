<h1>The <code>unsafe</code> Standard Package</h1>

<p>
The <code>unsafe</code> standard package in Go is a special package.
Why? This article will explain it in detail.
</p>

<h3>The Warnings From Go Official Documentation</h3>

<div>
The <code>unsafe</code> package documentation
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#pkg-overview">says</a>:
<div class="alert alert-success">
Packages that import <code>unsafe</code> may be non-portable
and are not protected by the Go 1 compatibility guidelines.
</div>
</div>

<div>
And the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility guidelines</a> says:
<div class="alert alert-success">
Packages that import <code>unsafe</code> may depend on internal properties of the Go implementation.
We reserve the right to make changes to the implementation that may break such programs.
</div>
</div>

<div>
Yes, the package name has implied that the <code>unsafe</code> package is unsafe.
But how dangerous is this package?
let's see what is the role of the <code>unsafe</code> package firstly.
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="unsafe-package-role"></p>
<h3>The Role Of The <code>unsafe</code> Package</h3>

<div>
Up tp now (Go 1.9), the <code>unsafe</code> package contains following resources:
<ul>
<li>three functions:</li>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Alignof">func Alignof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Offsetof">func Offsetof(selector ArbitraryType) uintptr</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Sizeof">func Sizeof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr</a></li>
  </ul>
<li>and one type:</li>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer">type Pointer *ArbitraryType</a></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Here, <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#ArbitraryType">ArbitraryType</a> is not a real type, it is just a placeholder here.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Unlike most functions in Go,
calls of the above three functions will be always evaluated at compile time,
instead of run time. This means their return results can be assigned to constants.
In other words, the three functions serves for compiler.
In fact, Go specification views the <code>unsafe</code> functions as built-in ones.
</p>

<p>
Besides the three functions, the only type, <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>,
in the <code>unsafe</code> standard package also serves for compiler.
</p>

<div>
For security reason, Go doesn't allow following direct conversions between values of:
<ul>
<li>two different safe pointer types
	which base types don't share the same underlying type,
	for example, <code>*int64</code> and <code>*float64;</code>
</li>
<li>a safe pointer type and an uintptr type.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
But with the help of <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>,
we can break the Go type and memory security and make above conversions possible.
How is this achieved? Let's read
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer">the rules listed in the docs of <code>unsafe</code> package</a>:
<ul>
<li>A safe pointer value of any type can be converted to an <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> can be converted to a value of any safe pointer type.</li>
<li>An uintptr value can be converted to a <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> can be converted to an uintptr type.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
These rules are consistent with Go spec:
<div class="alert alert-success">
Any pointer or value of underlying type <code>uintptr</code> can be
converted to a <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type and vice versa.
</div>
</div>

<p>
The rules show that <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> is much like the <code>void*</code> in C language.
Yes, <code>void*</code> in C language is dangerous!
</p>

<p>
Under above rules, for two different types <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code>,
a *T1 value can be concerted to a <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> value,
then the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> value can be converted to a <code>*T2</code> value
(or an uintptr value).
By this way, Go type and memory security is bypassed.
Surely, this way is dangerous if it is misused.
</p>

<div>
An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)
func main() {
	var n int64 = 5
	var pn = &n
	var pf = (*float64)(unsafe.Pointer(pn))
	// now, pn and pf are pointing at the same memory address
	fmt.Println(*pf) // 2.5e-323
	*pf = 3.14159
	fmt.Println(n) // 4614256650576692846
}
</code></pre>
<p>
The conversion in this example may be meaningless, but it is safe and legal
(<a href="#legal-use-cases">why is it safe?</a>).
</p>
</div>

<p>
So the role of the resources in <code>unsafe</code> package is serving for Go compilers,
and the role of the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type is to bypass Go type system and memory security.
</p>

<h3>More About <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> and <code>uintptr</code> Types</h3>

<div>
Here are some facts about <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> and <code>uintptr</code>
<ul>
<li><code>uintptr</code> is an interger type.
  <ul>
    <li>the memory block pointed by an <code>uintptr</code> value can be garbaged collected
    even if the <code>uintptr</code> value is still alive.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><code>unsafe.Pointer</code> is a pointer type.
  <ul>
    <li>but <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> values are can't be dereferenced.</li>
    <li>the memroy block pointed by an <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> value
        will not be garbage collected if the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> value is still alive.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><code>*unsafe.Pointer</code> is a general pointer type, just like <code>*int</code> etc.
	This means values of <code>*unsafe.Pointer</code>
	can be converted to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>, and vice versa.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
As <code>uintptr</code> is an interger type, <code>uintptr</code> values can do arithmetic operations.
So by using <code>uintptr</code> and <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>,
we can bypass the restriction that pointer values don't support arithmetic operations in Go:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	a := [4]int{0, 1, 2, 3}
	p1 := unsafe.Pointer(&a[1])
	p3 := unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(p1) + 2 * unsafe.Sizeof(a[0]))
	*(*int)(p3) = 6
	fmt.Println("a =", a) // a = [0 1 2 6]
	
	// ...

	type Person struct {
		name   string
		age    int
		gender bool
	}
	
	who := Person{"John", 30, true}
	pp := unsafe.Pointer(&who)
	pname := (*string)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(pp) + unsafe.Offsetof(who.name)))
	page := (*int)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(pp) + unsafe.Offsetof(who.age)))
	pgender := (*bool)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(pp) + unsafe.Offsetof(who.gender)))
	*pname = "Alice"
	*page = 28
	*pgender = false
	fmt.Println(who) // {Alice 28 false}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="dangerous"></p><h3>How Dangerous Is The <code>unsafe</code> Package?</h3>

<div>
About the <code>unsafe</code> package, Ian, one of the core member of Go team,
has <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/golang-nuts/Pi7VveWDUPc">confirmed</a>:
<ul>
<li>the signatures of the functions in <code>unsafe</code> package will not change in future Go versions,</li>
<li>and the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type will always there in future Go versions.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
So, the three functions in <code>unsafe</code> package don't look dangerous.
Rob Pike, the Go project leader, even
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5602">want to put them elsewhere</a>.
The only unsafety of the functions in <code>unsafe</code> package is their calls
may return different values in later go versions.
It is hardly to say this small unsafety is a danger.
</p>

<div>
It looks all the dangers of <code>unsafe</code> package are related to using <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>.
The <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer">unsafe package docs</a>
lists some cases of using unsafe.Pointer legally or illegally.
Here just lists part of the illegally use cases:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

// case A: conversions between unsafe.Pointer and uintptr
//         don't appear in the same expression
func illegalUseA() {
	fmt.Println("===================== illegalUseA")
	
	pa := new([4]int)
	
	// split the legal use
	// p1 := unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(pa)) + unsafe.Sizeof(pa[0]))
	// into two statements (illegal use):
	ptr := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(pa))
	p1 := unsafe.Pointer(ptr + unsafe.Sizeof(pa[0]))
	// "go vet" will make a warning for the above line:
	// possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer
	
	// the unsafe package docs, https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer,
	// thinks above splitting is illegal.
	// but the current Go compiler and runtime (1.9) can't detect
	// this illegal use.
	//
	// however, to make your program run well absolutely,
	// it is best to comply with the unsafe package docs.
	
	*(*int)(p1) = 123
	fmt.Println("*(*int)(p1)  :", *(*int)(p1)) //
}	

// case B: pointers are pointing at unknown addresses
func illegalUseB() {
	fmt.Println("===================== illegalUseB")
	
	a := [4]int{0, 1, 2, 3}
	p := unsafe.Pointer(&a)
	p = unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(p) + uintptr(len(a)) * unsafe.Sizeof(a[0]))
	// now p is pointing at the end of the memory occupied by value a.
	// up to now, although p is illegal, it is no problem.
	// but it would be dangerous if we modify the value pointed by p
	*(*int)(p) = 123
	fmt.Println("*(*int)(p)  :", *(*int)(p)) // 123 or not 123
	// the current Go compiler/runtime (1.9) and "go vet"
	// will not detect the illegal use here.
	
	// however, the current Go runtime (1.9) will
	// detect the illegal use and panic for the below code.
	p = unsafe.Pointer(&a)
	for i := 0; i <= len(a); i++ {
		*(*int)(p) = 123 // Go runtime (1.9) never panic here in the tests
		
		fmt.Println(i, ":", *(*int)(p))
		// panic at the above line for the last iteration, when i==4.
		// runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
		
		p = unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(p) + unsafe.Sizeof(a[0]))
	}
}

func main() {
	illegalUseA()
	illegalUseB()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
It is hard for compilers to detect the illegal <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> uses in a Go program.
Running <code>go vet</code> can help find some potential ones, but not all of them.
The same is for Go runtime, which also can't detect all the illegal uses.
Illegal <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> uses may make a program crash or behave weird
(sometimes normal and sometimes abnormal).
This is why using the <code>unsafe</code> package is dangerous.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="legal-use-cases"></p><h3>Conversion of a <code>*T1</code> to <code>*T2</code></h3>

<div>
For a conversion of a <code>*T1</code> to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>,
then to <code>*T2</code>, <code>unsafe</code> package docs says:
<div class="alert alert-success">
Provided that <code>T2</code> is no larger than <code>T1</code>
and that the two share an equivalent memory layout,
this conversion allows reinterpreting data of one type as data of another type.
</div>
<p>
This definition of <b><i>equivalent memory layout</i></b> is some vague.
And it looks <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16807">the Go team deliberately
make it vague</a>. This makes using the <code>unsafe</code> package more dangerous.
</p>
</div>

<p>
As Go team are not willing to make an accurate definition here,
this article also doesn't attempt to do this.
Here, a samll part of confirmed legal use cases are listed,
</p>

<h4>Legal Use Case 1: conversions between <code>[]T</code> and <code>[]MyT</code></h4>

<div>
In this example, we will use <code>int</code> as <code>T</code>
<pre><code class="language-go">type MyInt int</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
In Go, <code>[]int</code> and <code>[]MyInt</code> are two different types
and their <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types">underlying type</a> are themselves.
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Conversions">Values of
<code>[]int</code> can't be converted to <code>[]MyInt</code>, and vice versa</a>.
But with the help of <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>, the conversions become possible:
</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	type MyInt int
	
	a := []MyInt{0, 1, 2}
	// b := ([]int)(a) // error: cannot convert a (type []MyInt) to type []int
	b := *(*[]int)(unsafe.Pointer(&a))
	
	b[0]= 3
	
	fmt.Println("a =", a) // a = [3 1 2]
	fmt.Println("b =", b) // b = [3 1 2]
	
	a[2] = 9
	
	fmt.Println("a =", a) // a = [3 1 9]
	fmt.Println("b =", b) // b = [3 1 9]
}
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<h4>Legal Use Case 2: call pointer related fucntions in <code>sync/atomic</code> package</h4>

<div>
Most of the parameter and result types of following functions in
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/"><code>sync/atomic</code> package</a>
are either <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> or <code>*unsafe.Pointer</code>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#CompareAndSwapPointer">func CompareAndSwapPointer(addr *unsafe.Pointer, old, new unsafe.Pointer) (swapped bool)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#LoadPointer">func LoadPointer(addr *unsafe.Pointer) (val unsafe.Pointer)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#StorePointer">func StorePointer(addr *unsafe.Pointer, val unsafe.Pointer)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#SwapPointer">func SwapPointer(addr *unsafe.Pointer, new unsafe.Pointer) (old unsafe.Pointer)</a></li>
</ul>
To use these functions, the <code>unsafe</code> package must be imported.
<br/>
NOTE: <code>*unsafe.Pointer</code> is a general type, so a value of <code>*unsafe.Pointer</code>
can be converted to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>, and vice versa.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import (
	"unsafe"
	"sync/atomic"
)

type BlockChain struct {
	hash string
	last *BlockChain
}

// Don't do this, it is a nonsense.
// func (bc BlockChain) Last() *BlockChain {
// 	(*BlockChain)(atomic.LoadPointer((*unsafe.Pointer)(unsafe.Pointer(&bc.last))))
// }

func (bc *BlockChain) Last() *BlockChain {
	return (*BlockChain)(atomic.LoadPointer((*unsafe.Pointer)(unsafe.Pointer(&bc.last))))
}

func (bc *BlockChain) SetLast(last *BlockChain) {
	atomic.StorePointer((*unsafe.Pointer)(unsafe.Pointer(&bc.last)), unsafe.Pointer(last))
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <code>unsafe</code> package is serving for Go compiler instead of Go runtime.</li>
<li>Using <b>unsafe</b> as the package name is just to make you use this package carefully.</li>
<li>Using <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> is not always a bad idea, sometimes, we must use it.</li>
<li>The type system of Go are designed for both security and efficiency.
    But security is more important than efficiency in Go type system.
    Generally Go is performant,
    but sometimes the security really causes some inefficiencies in Go programs.
    The <code>unsafe</code> package is used for experienced programmers to
    avoid these inefficiencies,
    by breaking the security of Go type system, safely. </li>
<li>Again, surely, the <code>unsafe</code> package could be misused and is dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, as the unsafe mechanism may break the safety built by Go type system,
it is not recommended to use it as a regular manner.
please only use it when it is really needed, and use it very carefaully.
</p>
