<h1>Introduction Of Source Code Elements</h1>

<p>
Go is known for its simple and clean syntax.
This article will introduce the common source code elements in programming
and show a simple Go program so that
new gophers (Go programmers) will get a basic impression of Go code structures
and how all kinds of code elements are used in Go code.

</p>

<h3>Programming And Source Code Elements</h3>

<p>
Simply speaking,
programming can be viewed as manipulating
all kinds of operations in all kinds of ways.
Operations write data to and read data from
all kinds of hardware devices to achieve all kinds of goals.
For modern computers, elemental operations are low-level instructions,
such as CPU and GPU instructions.
Common hardware devices include memory, disk, network card, graphics card,
monitor, keyboard and mouse, etc.
</p>

<p>
Programming by manipulating low-level instructions directly
is tedious and error prone.
High-level programing languages make
some encapsulations for low-level operations,
and make some abstracts for data,
to make programing more intuitive and human friendly.
</p>

<p>
In popular high-level programming languages,
operations are mainly achieved by calling
<b>functions</b> and using <b>operators</b>.
Most popular high-level programming languages support several kinds of
conditional and loop <b>control flows</b>,
we can think them as special operations.
The syntaxes of these control flows are close to human languages
so that the code written by one programmers is easy to be understood by others.
</p>

<p>
Data is abstracted as <b>types</b> and <b>values</b>
in most high-level programming languages.
Types can be viewed as value templates,
and values can be viewed as type instances.
Most languages support several bulit-in types and custom types.
The type system of a programming language is the spirit of the language.
</p>

<p>
There may be a large quantity of values used in programming.
Some of them can be represented with their <b>literals</b>
(text representations) directly, but others can not.
To make programming convenient and less mistake prone, many values are named.
Such values include <b>variables</b> and named <b>constants</b>.
For the same reason, many functions and types also have names.
</p>

<p>
Named functions, named types and named values
(including variables and named constants)
are called <b>resources</b> in Go 101.
The names of resources must be
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html#identifier">identifiers</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many modern high-level programming languages
use <b>packages</b> to organize code.
A package must <b>import</b> another package
to use the exported (public) resources in the other package.
</p>

<p>
High-level programming code will be translated to low-level CPU instructions
by compilers to get executed.
To help compilers paser high-level programming code,
many words are reserved to prevent them being used as identifiers.
Such words are called
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html#keywords">keywords</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although the code written in high-level programming languages is
more undertandable than low-level machine machine languages,
we still need some comments for some code to explain the logic.
The example program in the next section contains many comments.
Most of the following code comments are for education purpose only,
they should not appear in production code.
We should try to write self-explanatory code in practice.
Surely, some commnets are necessary.
</p>

<h3>A Simple Go Demo Program</h3>

<p>
Let's view a short Go demo program to know all kinds of code elements in Go.
Like some other languages, in Go, line comments start with <code>//</code>,
and block comments are enclosed in pair of <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
</p>

<div>

Below is the demo Go program.
Please read the comments to get some explanations.
More explanations are following the program.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main // specify the pacakge name of the current source file.

import "math/rand" // import a standard package.

const MaxRand = 16 // a named constanted declararion.

/*
 StatRandomNumbers produces certain number of non-negative random
 integers which are less than MaxRand, and counts and returns the
 numbers of small and large ones among the produced random integers.
 The input, numRands, specifies the number of randoms to be produced.
*/
func StatRandomNumbers(numRands int) (int, int) { // a function declartion
	var a, b int // declare two variables (both are initilized as 0).
	for i := 0; i < numRands; i++ { // a for-loop control flow.
		if rand.Intn(MaxRand) < MaxRand { // an if-else control flow.
			a = a + 1
		} else {
			b++ // same as: b = b + 1
		}
	}
	return a, b // this function has two results to return.
}

// The main function is the entry function of this program.
func main() {
	var num = 100
	// Call StatRandomNumbers and two buint-in functions.
	x, y := StatRandomNumbers(num) // a short variable declaration.
	print("Result: ", x, " + ", y, " = ", num, "? ")
	println(x+y == num)
}
</code></pre>

Run this program (assume the above source code is saved in a file
named <code>basic-code-element-demo.go</code>):
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run basic-code-element-demo.go
Result: 46 + 54 = 100? true
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>
In the above program, the words with blue color are keywords
(JavaScript needs to be enabed to colorize the code).
Most other words in the program are identifiers.
Please read <a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html">keywords and identifiers</a>
for more information keywords and identifiers.
<p>

<p>
The green <code>int</code> words at line <i>14</i> and line <i>16</i>
denotes the buint-in <code>int</code> type, one of many kinds of integer types in Go.
The <code>16</code> at line <i>5</i>, <code>0</code> at line <i>18</i>,
<code>1</code> at line <i>23</i> and <code>100</code> at line <i>33</i>
are some value literals of the <code>int</code> type.
The <code>"Result: "</code> at line <i>39</i> is a value literal
of the built-in <code>string</code> type.
Value literals must be not identifiers.
Please read <a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">basic types and their value literals</a>
for more information on built-in basic types and their value literals.
Some other types (composite types) will be introduced later in other articles.
</p>

<p>
Line <code>23</code> is an assignment.
Line <i>5</i> declares a named constant, <code>MaxRand</code>.
Line <i>16</i> and line <i>33</i> declare three variables,
with the standard variable declaration form.
The variable <code>i</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> at line <i>37</i>
are declared with the short variable declaration form.
Compilers will deduce that the types of <code>i</code>, <code>num</code>,
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are all <code>int</code>.
Please read <a href="constants-and-variables.html">constants and variables</a>
for more information on untyped values, type deduction,
value assignments and how to declare variables and named constants.
</p>

<p>
There are many operators are used in the program, such as the less-than
comparison operator <code>&lt;</code> at line <i>18</i>,
the equal-to operator <code>==</code> at line <i>40</i>,
and the addition operator <code>+</code> at line <i>23</i> and line <i>40</i>.
The values involved in an operator operation are called operands.
Please read <a href="operators.html">common operators</a> for more imformation
More operators will be introduced in other articles later.
</p>

<p>
At line <i>39</i> and line <i>40</i>, two built-in functions,
<code>print</code> and <code>println</code>, are called.
A custom function <code>StatRandomNumbers</code> is delcared from line
<i>14</i> to line <i>29</i>, and it is called at line <i>37</i>.
Line <i>22</i> also calls a function, <code>Intn</code>,
which is a function declared in the <code>math/rand</code> standard package.
A function call is a function operation.
The input values used in a function call are called arguments.
Please read <a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html">function
declarations and calls</a> for more imformation.
</p>

<p><i>
(Note, the built-in <code>print</code> and <code>println</code> functions
are not recommended to be used in formal Go programming.
The corresponding functions in the <code>fmt</code> standard packages
should be used instead in formal Go projects.
In Go 101, the two functions are only used in the several starting articles.)
</i></p>

<p>
Line <i>1</i> specifies the package name of the currrent soruce file.
The <code>main</code> entry function must be declared in a pakcage also
called <code>main</code>.
Line <i>3</i> imports a package, the <code>math/rand</code>
standard code package. The function <code>Intn</code> delcared in this
standard pacakge is called at line <i>22</i>.
Please read <a href="packages-and-imports.html">code packages and package imports</a>
for more information on how to organize code packages and import packages.
</p>

<p>
The article <a href="expressions-and-statements.html">expressions, statements
and simple statements</a> will introduce what are expressions and statemetns.
In particular, all kinds of simple statements, which are special statements,
are listed.
Some portions of all kinds of control flows must be simple statements,
and some portions must be expressions.
</p>

<p>
In the <code>StatRandomNumbers</code> function body, two control flows are used.
One is a <code>for</code> loop control flow, which nests
the other one, a <code>if-else</code> conditional control flow.
Please read <a href="control-flows.html">basic control flows</a>
for more informations on all kinds of basic control flows.
Some other special controls flows will be introduced in other articles later.
</p>

<p>
There are some blank lines in the above program,
to make the code get a better readability.
And as this program is for code elements introduction purpose,
there are many comments in it.
Except the documentation comment for the <code>StatRandomNumbers</code>,
other comments are for demostration purpose only
We should try to make code self-explanatory
and only use neccessary comments in formal projects.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="line-break"></p>
<h3>About Line Breaks</h3>

<div>
Like many other languages, Go also use a pair of braces (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>)
to form an explicit code block. In Go programming, coding style can't be
arbitrary. For example, many of the starting curly braces (code>{</code>)
can't be put on the next line. If we modify the <code>StatRandomNumbers</code>
function declartion in the above program as the following,
the program will fail to compile.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func StatRandomNumbers(numRands int) (int, int)
{ // syntax error
	var a, b int
	for i := 0; i < numRands; i++
	{ // syntax error
		if rand.Intn(MaxRand) < MaxRand
		{ // syntax error
			a = a + 1
		} else {
			b++
		}
	}
	return a, b
}
</code></pre>

<p></p>
Some programmers may don't like the line break restrictions.
But the restrictions have two benefits:
<ol>
<li>
	they make compilation faster.
</li>
<li>
	they make the coding styles written by different gophers similar,
	so that it is more easily for gophers to read and understand
	the code written by other gophers.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
We can learn more about line break rules in
<a href="line-break-rules.html">a later article</a>.
At present, we should avoid putting a starting curly brace on a new line.
In other words, generally, the first non-blank character of a code line
should not be the starting curly brace character.
</p>
