<h2>Methods In Go</h2>

<!---

need a article: builtin generic: type and functions.

for type declartions, need to clarify:
* the methods are not copied, 
* but the methods axauried by embedding otehr types will be copied.

<p>
Go has some object-orient programming elements.
Method is one of these elements.
This article will explain method related concepts in Go.
</p>

<h3>Method Declarations</h3>

<div>
In Go, we can (explicitly) declare a method for type
<code>T</code> and <code>*T</code>, 
where <code>T</code> must satisfiy 4 conditions:
<ol>
<li><code>T</code> must be defined type;</li>
<li><code>T</code> must be defined in the same package as the method declaration;</li>
<li><code>T</code> must not be a pointer type;</li>
<li><code>T</code> must not be an interface type.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<code>T</code> is called the receiver base type of any method declared
for both type <code>T</code> and <code>*T</code>.
(Below will explain what are receivers.)
</p>

<p>
We can also declare methods for alias types of the <code>T</code> <code>*T</code> types specified above,
the effect is the same as declaring methods for the <code>T</code> <code>*T</code> types themselves.
</p>

<p>
If a method is declared for a type, we can say the type has (own) the method.
</p>

From the above listed conditions, we will get the conclusion that
we can never (explicitly) define method for
<ul>
<li>
	built-in basic types, such as <code>int</code> and <code>string</code>,
	for we can't define methods in the <code>builtin</code> standard package.
</li>
<li>
	interface types. But an interface type can own methods.
	Please read <a href="type-embedding.html">Interfaces In Go</a> for details.
</li>
<li>
	unnamed types except the pointer types as <code>*T</code> described above,
	including unnamed array, map, slice, function, channel and struct types.
	However, if an unnamed struct type embeds other types which have methods,
	then compiler will implicitly define some methods for the unnamed struct type
	and the unnamed pointer type whose base type is the unnamed struct type.
	Please read <a href="type-embedding.html">Type Embedding</a> for details.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A method declaration is similiar to a function declaration,
but it has an extra parameter declaration part.
The extra parameter is called a receiver parameter.
Each method must be declared with one and only one receiver parameter.
The receiver parameter must be enclosed in a <code>()</code>
and declared between the <code>func</code> keyword and the method name.
The type of the receiver parameter is called the receiver type of that method.
</p>

Here are some method declaration examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Age and int are two distinct types.
// We can't define methods for int, but can for Age.
type Age int
func (age Age) LargerThan(a Age) bool {
	return age > a
}
func (age *Age) Increase() {
	*age++
}

// Receiver of defined function type.
type FilterFunc func(in int) bool
func (ff FilterFunc) Filte(in int) bool {
	return ff(in)
}

// Receiver of defined map type.
type StringSet map[string]struct{}
func (ss StringSet) Has(key string) bool {
	_, present := ss[key]
	return present
}
func (ss StringSet) Add(key string) {
	ss[key] = struct{}{}
}
func (ss StringSet) Remove(key string) {
	delete(ss, key)
}

// Receiver of defined struct type.
type Book struct {
	pages int
}
func (b Book) Pages() int {
	return b.pages
}
func (b *Book) SetPages(pages int) {
	b.pages = pages 
}
</code></pre>

<p>
From the above example, we know that the receiver base types
not only can be struct types, but also can be
other kinds of types, such as basic types and container types,
as long as the receiver base types satisfy the 4 conditions listed above.
</p>

<p>
In some other programming languages,
the receiver parameter name is always either implicit <code>this</code> (C++ and Java)
or explicit <code>self</code> (Python) .
The two receiver parameter names are not recommended in Go programming.
</p>

<p>
The receiver of type <code>*T</code> are called <b><i>pointer receiver</i></b>,
non-pointer reveivers are called <b><i>value receivers</i></b>.
Personally, I don't recommand to view the terminology <b><i>pointer</i></b>
as an oppoiste of the terminology <b><i>value</i></b>,
for pointer values are just special values.
But, I am not against using the pointer receiver and value receiver terminologies here.
The reason will be explained below.
</p>
</div>

<p><i>
(Method names can be the blank identifier <code>_</code>.
A type can have multiple methods with the blank identifier as names.
But such methods can never be called.)
</i></p>

<h3>Each Method Corresponds To An Implicit Function</h3>

<div>
For each method declaration, compiler will declare a corresponding implicit function for it.
By the example of the last two methods whose receiver base types
are <code>Book</code> listed in the last section,
two following functions are implicitly declared by compiler:

<!---
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Book.Pages(b Book) int {
	return b.pages
}

func (*Book).SetPages(b *Book, pages int) {
	b.pages = pages
}
</code></pre>
-->

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Book.Pages(b Book) int {
	return b.Pages() // call the corresponding method
}

func (*Book).SetPages(b *Book, pages int) {
	b.SetPages(pages) // call the corresponding method
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In each of the two implicit function declarations, the receiver parameter
is removed from its correponding method declaration and insert
the receiver parameter into the normal parameter list as the first one.
</p>

The implict method names, <code>Book.Pages</code> and <code>(*Book).SetPages</code>,
are both of the form <code>TypeLiteral.MethodName</code>.
As identifiers in Go can't contain the period special characters,
the two implict function names are not legal identifiers,
so the two function can't be dclared explicitly.
They can only be declared by compiler implicitly, and they really can be called:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Book struct {
	pages int
}
func (b Book) Pages() int {
	return b.pages
}
func (b *Book) SetPages(pages int) {
	b.pages = pages
}

func main() {
	var book Book
	// Call the two implicit decalred functions.
	(*Book).SetPages(&book, 123)
	fmt.Println(Book.Pages(book)) // 123
}
</code></pre>

<!---
In fact, compiler will also rewrite the method bodies to call the implicit functions:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (b Book) Pages() int {
	return Book.Pages(b)
}

func (b *Book) SetPages(pages int) {
	(*Book).SetPages(b, 123)
}
</code></pre>
-->

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="implicit-pointer-methods"></p>
<h3>Implicit Methods With Pointer Reveivers</h3>

<div>
For each method declared for value receiver type <code>T</code>,
a corresponding method with the same name will be
implictly declared by compiler for type <code>*T</code>.
By the example above, the <code>Pages</code> method is declared for type <code>Book</code>,
so compiler will implicitly declare a method with the same name <code>Pages</code>
for type <code>*Book</code>. The same name method only contain one line of code,
which is a call to the implicit function <code>Book.Pages</code>:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (b *Book) Pages() int {
	return (*b).Pages() // call the value method
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This is why I don't reject to use the value receiver terminology
(as the opposite of pointer receiver).
After all, when we expliclty declare a method for a non-pointer type,
in fact two methods are declared, the explicit one for the non-pointer type,
the other implicit one is for the corresponding pointer type.
</p>

As the last section has mentioned, for each of the implicitly decalred methods,
compiler will also declare a correponding implicit function for it:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (*Book).Pages(b *Book) int {
	return b.Pages() // call the pointer method
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In other words, for each explicitly declared method with a value receiver,
two implicit functions and one implicit method will also be declared correspondingly.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Method Signatures And Method Sets</h3>

<div>
Each declared method has a signature.
The signature of a declared method doesn't include the <code>func</code> keyword
and the receiver part in the method declaration.
Following are the method signatures of the above declared methods:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">Pages() int
SetPages(pages int)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Each type has a method set.
The method set of a type is composed of all the signatures of
the methods declared, either explicitly or implicitly, for the type,
except the ones whose names are the blank identifier <code>_</code>.
From the last serction, we know that the method set of a type <code>T</code>
must be a subset of the method set of type <code>*T</code>
if <code>*T</code> can have methods.
Method sets play an important role in the polymorphism feature of Go.
About polymorphism, please read <a href="interface.html">Interfaces In Go</a> for details.
</p>

<div>
The method set of the following types are always blank:
<ul>
<li>built-in basic types.</li>
<li>defined pointer types.</li>
<li>unnamed pointer types whose base types are interface or pointer types.</li>
<li>unnamed array, slice, map, function and channel types.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Method Values And Method Calls</h3>

<p>
Methods are special functions in fact.
When a method is declared for a type, then each value of the type
will own an immutable member of an function type.
The member name is the same as the method name.
The function type is the same as the function declared
with the form of the method declaration but without the reveiver part.
The member is often called called a member function.
The member function can also be called the method of its corresponding value.
</p>

<p>
A method call is just a call to such a member function.
For a value <code>v</code>, its method <code>m</code> can be accessed
with the selector <code>v.m</code>.
</p>

<p><i>
(For the just mentioned reason,
if the base type of the receiver type of a method is a stuct type,
then the method can't share the same name with any explicitly declared field
of the struct type, except the name is the blank identifier.)
</i></p>

<div>
Example of method calls:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Book struct {
	pages int
}

func (b Book) Pages() int {
	return b.pages
}

func (b *Book) SetPages(pages int) {
	b.pages = pages
}

func main() {
	var book Book
	
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", book.Pages)       // func() int
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", (&book).SetPages) // func(int)
	// &book has an implicit method.
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", (&book).Pages)    // func() int
	
	(&book).SetPages(123)
	fmt.Println(book.Pages()) // 123
	// Call the impliict method of &book.
	fmt.Println((&book).Pages()) // 123
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, the value <code>book</code> is call the base value of both
the receiver arguments of the <code>Pages</code> and <code>SetPages</code> methods.
</p>

<p><i>
(Different from C language, there is not the <code>-&gt;</code> operator in Go
to call methods with pointer receivers,
so <code>(&amp;book)-&gt;SetPages(123)</code> is illegal in Go.)
</i></p>

Method calls make Go programs clean and more readable.
In fact, the above example can be cleaner.
The line <code>(&amp;book).SetPages(123)</code> in the above example
can be simplified to <code>book.SetPages(123)</code>.
But how can this happen?
After all, the value <code>book</code> has not a method called <code>SetPages</code>.
Aha, this is just a syntax sugar to make progrmaming convenient.
This sugar only works for addressable values of type <code>Book</code>.
Compiler will automitically take the address of the addressable values
when they are passed as the receiver arguments of the <code>SetPages</code> method.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go"> ...

// Function results are not addressable in Go.
func MakeBook() Book {
	return Book{}
}

func main() {
	var book Book
	book.SetPages(123) // <=> (&book).SetPages(123)
	fmt.Println(book.Pages()) // 123

	// error: MakeBook() is not addressable.
	MakeBook().SetPages(123)
}
</code></pre>

<!---
In fact, the method value <code>book.Pages</code>
can be viewed as a closure returned by:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func() func() int {
	return func() int {
		Book.Pages(b)
	}
}(book)
</code></pre>

and the method value <code>(&book).SetPages</code>
can be viewed as closures returned by:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (b *Book) func(int) {
	return func(pages int) {
		(*Book).SetPages(b, pages)
	}
}(&book)
</code></pre>
-->

<p>
As above just mentioned, when a method is declared for a type,
each value of the type will own a member function.
Zero values are not exceptions, whether or not the zero values
can be represented by <code>nil</code>.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

type StringSet map[string]struct{}
func (ss StringSet) Has(key string) bool {
	_, present := ss[key] // Never panic here,
	                      // even if ss is nil.
	return present
}

type Age int
func (age *Age) IsNil() bool {
	return age == nil
}
func (age *Age) Increase() {
	*age++ // If age is a nil pointer, then
	       // dereferencing it will panic.
}

func main() {
	_ = (StringSet(nil)).Has   // will not panic
	_ = ((*Age)(nil)).IsNil    // will not panic
	_ = ((*Age)(nil)).Increase // will not panic
	
	_ = (StringSet(nil)).Has("key") // will not panic
	_ = ((*Age)(nil)).IsNil()       // will not panic

	// This line will panic. But the panic is not caused
	// by invoking the method. It is caused by the nil
	// pointer dereference in the method body.
	((*Age)(nil)).Increase()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Receiver Parameters Are Copies Of Receiver Arguments</h3>

<p>
Same as general parameters, the receiver parameter within a method body
is just a copy of the receiver argument passed by the outside caller.
</p>

<p>
For the receiver parameter within a method body is just
a copy of the receiver argument passed by the outside caller,
the <a href="underlying-values.html">the direct part</a> of
outside receiver argument can't be modified in the method body through modifying
the receiver parameter, whether or not the receiver is a pointer one or a value one.
But the modifications on the value referenced by a pointer receiver
(or the underlying values referenced by the direct part of the receiver)
can be reflected to the outside of the method body.
</p>

<div>
An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Book struct {
	pages int
}

func (b Book) SetPages(pages int) {
	b.pages = pages
}

func main () {
	var b Book
	b.SetPages(123)
	fmt.Println(b.pages) // 0
}
</code></pre>

Another example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Book struct {
	pages int
}

type Books []Book

func (books Books) Modify() {
	// Modifications on the underlying part of the receiver
	// will be reflected to outside of the method.
	books[0].pages = 500
	// Modifications on the direct part of the receiver
	// will not be reflected to outside of the method.
	books = append(books, Book{789})
}

func main () {
	var books = Books{{123}, {456}}
	books.Modify()
	fmt.Println(books) // [{500} {456}]
}
</code></pre>

Sone off topic, if the two lines in the orders of
the above <code>Modify</code> method are exchanged, then both of the modifications
will not be reflected to outside of the method body.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (books Books) Modify() {
	books = append(books, Book{789})
	books[0].pages = 500
}

func main () {
	var books = Books{{123}, {456}}
	books.Modify()
	fmt.Println(books) // [{123} {456}]
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The reason here is that the <code>append</code> call will allocate a new space
to storage the elements of the slice receiver.
</p>

To make both of the modifications be reflected to outside of the method body,
the receiver of the method must be a pointer one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (books *Books) Modify() {
	*books = append(*books, Book{789})
	(*books)[0].pages = 500
}

func main () {
	var books = Books{{123}, {456}}
	books.Modify()
	fmt.Println(books) // [{500} {456} {789}]
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Declare A Methods With Pointer Receiver Or Value Reveiver?</h3>

<p>
Firstly, from the last section,
we know that sometimes we must define methods with pointer receivers.
</p>

<p>
In fact, we can always define methods with pointer recievers without any logic problems.
It is just a matter of program performance that sometimes if is better to define methods
with value receivers.
</p>

<div>
For the cases value receivers and pointer receivers are both acceptable,
here are some factors needed to be considered to make decisions:
<ul>
<li>
	too many pointer copies may cause heavier workload for garbage colllector.
</li>
<li>
	pointer value assignments during garbage collecting will be some costlier
	than non-pointer value assignments.
</li>
<li>
	if the value size of a receiver type is large,
	then the receiver argument copy cost may be not neglectable.
	In particular if the passed argument is an interface value
	(please read <a href="interface.html#polymorphism">polymorphism</a> for details),
	there will be two copies made in the argument passing.
	Here we just need to know that
	pointer values are all <a href="value-copy-cost.html">small sized values</a>.
	In fact, for the official Go compiler and runtime,
	types other than array and struct types are all small sized types.
	Struct types with very few fields are also small sized.)
</li>
<li>
	mixing value receivers and pointer receivers for the same base type,
	is more likely to cause data races if the defined methods
	are called across multiple goroutines.
</li>
<li>
	values of the types in the <code>sync</code> standard package
	should not be copied, so defining methods with value receivers for
	sturct types which embedding the types in the <code>sync</code>
	standard package is problematic.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Sometimes, it may be hard to make a decision a method should use
a pointer receiver or a value receiver,
then just choose pointer receiver.
</p>
