<h1>Expressions, Statements And Simple Statements</h1>

<p>
This article will introduce expressions and statements in Go.
</p>

<p>
Simply speaking, expressions represent values and statements represent operations.
However, in fact, some special expressions each may represent several values,
and some statements may be composed of several sub operations/statements.
And some expressions can also be used as statements.
</p>

<p>
Simple statements are some special statements.
In Go, some portions in all kinds of control flows must be
simple statements, and some portions must be expressions.
Control flows will be introduced in the next Go 101 article.
</p>

<p>
This article will not make accurate definitions for expressions and statements.
It is hard to achieve this.
This article will only list some express and statement cases.
Not all kinds of expressions and statements will be covered in this article,
but all kinds of simple statements will be listed.
</p>

<h3>Some Expression Cases</h3>

<p>
A value literal, a named constant and a variable are all expressions.
In fact, later we will learn that custom declared functions are function values,
so they are also expressions.
</p>

<p>
The operations (without the assignment part) using the operators introduced in
<a href="operators-and-functions.html">the last article</a>
are all expressions.
There are more operator operations which will be introduced in other articles
are also expressions.
</p>

<p>
By the way, if all the operands involved in an operator operation
(without the assignment part) are constants,
then the operator operation is called a constant expression.
Constant expressions are evaluated at compile time instead of run time.
</p>

<p>
If a function returns exact one result,
then its calls (without the assignment parts) are expressions.
Calls of functions without results are not expressions.
Calls of functions with more than one results can are expressions,
but such expressions can used be used at some specific senarios.
Go functions will explained detailedly in the article
<a href="function.html">functions in Go</a> later.
<p>

<p>
Methods can be viewed as special functions.
So the above mentioned function cases also apply to methods.
Methods will explained detailedly in the article
<a href="method.html">method in Go</a> later.
</p>

<p>
Channel receive operations (without the assignment parts)
are also expressions.
Channel operations will be explained in the article
<a href="goroutine-and-channel-introduction.html">goroutine and
channel introduction</a> later.
</p>

<h3>Some Simple Statement Cases</h3>

<div>
There are six kinds of simple statements.

<ol>
<li>
	short variable declaration forms
</li>
<li>
	pure value assignments (not mixing with variable declarations)
</li>
<li>
	function/method calls and channel receive operations without the assignment parts.
</li>
<li>
	channel send operations.
</li>
<li>
	nothing. This is called blank statement.
</li>
<li>
	<code>x++</code> and <code>x--</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again. channel receive and sent operations will be incroduced in the article
<a href="goroutine-and-channel-introduction.html">goroutine and
channel introduction</a>.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Go supports the two syntaxes.
However, the two forms can't be used as values.
In other words, they are not expressions.
<code>x++</code> is equivalent to <code>x = x + 1</code>,
and <code>x--</code> is equivalent to <code>x = x - 1</code>.
Go doesn't support the <code>++x</code> and <code>--x</code> syntaxes.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Some Non-Simple Statement Cases</h3>

<p>
The standard variable declaration forms are statements but not simple statements.
</p>

<p>
Constant, type and function declarations are non-simple statements.
A function declaration statement may contains many sub statements.
</p>

<p>
All the control flows introduced in the next article
<a href="basic-control-flows.html">basic control flows</a>
are also non-simple statements.
