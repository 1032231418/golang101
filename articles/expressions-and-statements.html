<h1>Expressions, Statements And Simple Statements</h1>

<p>
This article will introduce expressions and statements in Go.
</p>

<p>
Simply speaking, expressions represent values and statements represent operations.
However, in fact, some special expressions each may be composed of and represent several values,
and some statements may be composed of several sub operations/statements.
And some expressions can also be used as statements.
</p>

<p>
Simple statements are some special statements.
In Go, some portions in all kinds of control flows must be
simple statements, and some portions must be expressions.
Control flows will be introduced in the next Go 101 article.
</p>

<p>
This article will not make accurate definitions for expressions and statements.
It is hard to achieve this.
This article will only list some express and statement cases.
Not all kinds of expressions and statements will be covered in this article,
but all kinds of simple statements will be listed.
</p>

<h3>Some Expression Cases</h3>

<p>
A value literal, a named constant and a variable are all expressions.
</p>

<p>
The operations (without the assignment part) using the operators introduced in
the article <a href="operators.html">common operators</a> are all expressions.
There are more operator operations which will be introduced in other articles
are also expressions.
</p>

<p>
By the way, if all the operands involved in an operator operation
(without the assignment part) are constants,
then the operator operation is called a constant expression.
Constant expressions are evaluated at compile time instead of run time.
</p>

<p>
If a function returns exact one result,
then its calls (without the assignment parts) are expressions.
Calls of functions without results are not expressions.
We have learned that a function call may return multiple results in the article
<a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html">function declarations and calls</a>.
Such function calls are called multi-value expressions.
Multi-value expressions can only be be used at some specific senarios.
<p>

<p>
Most expressions in Go a single-value expression.
Later, out of the currrent article, unless otherwise specified,
when an expression is mentioned, we mean it is a single-value expression.
</p>

<p>
Methods can be viewed as special functions.
So the above mentioned function cases also apply to methods.
Methods will explained detailedly in the article
<a href="method.html">method in Go</a> later.
</p>

<p>
In fact, later we will learn that custom functions, including methods,
are all function values, so they are also expressions.
We can learn more about <a href="function.html">function types and values</a> later.
</p>

<p>
Channel receive operations (without the assignment parts)
are also expressions.
Channel operations will be explained in the article
<a href="goroutine-and-channel-introduction.html">goroutine and
channel introduction</a> later.
</p>

<p>
Some expressions may have optional results in Go.
We can learn such expressions in other Go 101 articles later.
</p>

<h3>Simple Statement Cases</h3>

<div>
There are six kinds of simple statements.

<ol>
<li>
	short variable declaration forms
</li>
<li>
	pure value assignments (not mixing with variable declarations),
	including <code>x op= y</code> operations.
</li>
<li>
	function/method calls and channel receive operations without the assignment parts.
	Some of these simple statements can also be used as expressions.
</li>
<li>
	channel send operations.
</li>
<li>
	nothing. This is called blank statement.
</li>
<li>
	<code>x++</code> and <code>x--</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again. channel receive and sent operations will be incroduced in the article
<a href="goroutine-and-channel-introduction.html">goroutine and
channel introduction</a>.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Go supports the two syntaxes.
However, the two forms can't be used as values.
In other words, they are not expressions.
<code>x++</code> is equivalent to <code>x = x + 1</code>,
and <code>x--</code> is equivalent to <code>x = x - 1</code>,
where expression <code>x</code> will only be evaludated once.
Go doesn't support the <code>++x</code> and <code>--x</code> syntaxes.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Some Non-Simple Statement Cases</h3>

<div>
An incomplete non-simple statements list:

<ul>
<li>
	standard variable declaration forms. Yes, short variable declarations are simple statements, but standard ones are not.
</li>
<li>
	name constant declarations.
</li>
<li>
	custom type declarations.
</li>
<li>
	package import declarations.
</li>
<li>
	explicit code blocks.
	An explicit code block starts with a <code>{</code> and ends with a <code>}</code>.
	A code block may contains many sub statements.
</li>
<li>
	function declarations. 
	A function declaration may contains many sub statements.
</li>
<li>
	control flows and code execution jumps.
	Each control flow is composed of many sub statements.
	The next article <a href="basic-control-flows.html">basic control flows</a>
	will introduce the basic control flows in Go.
</li>
<li>
	<code>return</code> lines in function declarations.
</li>
<li>
	deferred function calls and goroutine creations.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples Of Expressions And Statements</h3>

<div>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Some non-Simple Statements.
import "time"
var a = 123
const B = "Go"
type Choice bool
func f() int {
	for a < 10 {
		break
	}

	// This is an solo explicit code block.
	{
		// ...
	}
	return 567
}

// Some simple Statements.
c := make(chan bool) // c is a a channel value of type "chan bool".
a = 789
a += 5
f()     // here f() is a simple statement.
a = f() // here f() is used as the source value of a pure assignment.
a++
a--
c <- true // a channel send operation (a simple statement).
<-c       // a channel receive operation (used as a simple statement).
z := <-c  // a channel receive operation is used as an expression.

// Some expressions.
123
true
B
B + " language"
a - 789
a > 0 // an untyped boolean value
f()   // an expression which can be viewed as an int value.
f     // an function value of type "func ()".
<-c   // an expression which can be viewed as a bool value.
