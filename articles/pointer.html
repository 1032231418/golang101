<p>
Same as C language, Go also supports pointer values.
Go pointers and C pointers are much similar in may aspects,
but there are also some differences of pointers between Go and C.
This artcile will list all kinds of concepts and details related to pointers in Go.
</p>

<h3>Memory Addresses</h3>

<p>
A memory address means an offset (number of bytes) from the start point of
the whole memory managed by a system (generally, operation system).
</p>

<p>
Generally, a memory address is stored as an unsigned native (interger) word.
The size of a native word is 4 (bytes) on 32-bit architectures and 8 (bytes)
on 64-bit architectures.
So the theoretical maximum memory space size is 2<sup>32</sup> bytes,
a.k.a. 4GB (1GB == 2<sup>30</sup> bytes), on 32-bit architectures,
and is 2<sup>34</sup>GB (16 exibytes) on 64-bit architectures.
</p>

<p>
Memory addresses are often represented with hex integer literals,
such as <code>0x1234CDEF</code>.
</p>

<h3>Value Addresses</h3>

<p>
The address of a value means the start address of the memory segment
occupied by the <a href="type-system-overview.html#value-part">direct part</a>
of the value.
</p>

<p>
The next article, <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a>,
will introduce values of which kinds of types may
have indirect underlying parts.
</p>

<h3>What Are Pointers?</h3>

<p>
A pointer is a special value, which can storage a memory address.
In fact, we often call a memory address as a pointer, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Generally, the stored memory address in a pointer
is the address of another value.
Unlike C language, for safety reason,
there are some restrictions made for Go pointers.
Please read the following sections for details.
</p>

<h3>Go Pointer Types And Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
Same as C langauge, an unnamed pointer type can be represented with <code>*T</code>,
where <code>T</code> can be an arbitrary type.
Type <code>T</code> is called the base type of pointer type <code>*T</code>.
</p>

<p>
We can declare named pointer types,
but generally this is not recommended.
Unnamed pointer types have better readabilities than named ones.
</p>

<p>
If the <a href="type-system.html#underlying-type">underlying type</a>
of a defined pointer type is <code>*T</code>,
then the base type of the defined pointer type is <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
Two non-defined pointer types with the same base type are the same type.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">*int  // A unnamed pointer type whose base type is int.
**int // A multi-level unnamed pointer type whose base type is *int.

type Ptr *int // Ptr is a defined pointer type whose base type is int.
type PP *Ptr  // PP is a defined pointer type whose base type is Ptr.
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Zero values of any pointer types are represented with the predeclared <code>nil</code>.
No addresses are stored in <code>nil</code> pointer values.
</p>

<p>
A pointer value of a pointer type whose base type is <code>T</code>
can be called a <code>T</code> pointer.
The value located at (the address stored in) a non-nil
<code>T</code> pointer will be always viewed as
a value of type <code>T</code> by compilers.
</p>

</div>

<h3>How To Get A Pointer Value And What Are Addressable Values?</h3>

<div>
There are two ways to get a non-nil pointer value.
<ol>
<li>
	The built-in <code>new</code> function can be used to allocate memory for a value
	of any type. <code>new(T)</code> will allocate memory for a <code>T</code> value
	and return the address of the <code>T</code> value.
	The allocated value is a zero value of type <code>T</code>.
	The returned address is viewed as a pointer value of type <code>*T</code>.
</li>
<li>
	We can also take the addresses of some values in Go.
	Values can be taken addresses are called addressable values.
	For an addressable value <code>t</code> of type <code>T</code>,
	we can use the expression <code>&amp;t</code> to
	take the address of <code>t</code>,
	where <code>&amp;</code> is the operator to take value addresses.
	The type of <code>&amp;t</code> is viewed as <code>*T</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
All variables are addressable and all constants are unaddressable.
The fields of an addressable struct value are also addressable.
Not all values stored in memory at run time are addressable in Go.
We can learn other adressable and unadressable values from other articles later.
If you have already been familar with Go, you can read 
<a href="summaries.html#not-addressable">this summary</a> to get
the lists of adressable and unadressable values in Go.
</p>

<p>
Although addressable values can be modified,
their addressess are immutable in their respective lifetime.
</p>

<p>
The next section will show how to get pointer values.
</p>

<h3>Pointer Dereference</h3>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Given a pointer value <code>p</code> of type <code>T<sub>p</sub></code>,
how to get the value at the address stored in the pointer?
Just use the expression <code>*p</code>, where <code>*</code> is called dereference operator.
<code>*p</code> is call the dereference of poiner <code>p</code>.
Pointer dereference is the inverse process of address taking.
The result of <code>*p</code> is a value of the base type of <code>T<sub>p</sub></code>.
</p>

<div>
The following programm shows some address taking
and pointer dereference examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	p0 := new(int)   // allocate memory
	fmt.Println(p0)  // a hex integer string
	fmt.Println(*p0) // dereference. Print 0.
	
	// x is a copy of the value at the address stored in p0.
	x := *p0
	p1 := &x // take address of x
	fmt.Printf("%T, %T \n", p0, p1) // *int, *int 
	fmt.Println(p0 == p1) // false
	
	p2 := &x // also take address of x
	fmt.Println(p1 == p2) // true
	
	p3 := &*p0 // same as: &(*p0)
	fmt.Println(p0 == p3) // true
	
	y := *&x // same as : *(&x)
	fmt.Println(y == x) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>About The Word "Reference"</h3>

<p>
In Go 101, the word "reference" means indicates a relation.
For example, if a pointer value storages the address of another value,
then we can say the pointer value (directly) references the other value,
and the other value has at least one reference.
The uses of the word "reference" in Go 101 are consistent with Go specification.
</p>

<h3>Why Do We Need Pointers?</h3>

<p>
All value assignments in Go are value copying.
Sometimes, we don't want to copy a value in assignments,
then we can copy the poitner to the value instead.
Followings are two specified cases.
</p>

<div>
Sometimes, a value needs to be referenced by multiple values simultaneously.
For example, for a binary tree data structure,
to perform all kinds of tree operations,
each parernt node needs to be referenced by its two children nodes
(and the two children nodes also needs to be referenced by that parent node).
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type TreeNode struct {
	parent *TreeNode
	left   *TreeNode
	right  *TreeNode
	// other data ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Each argument in a function call will be assigned (copied)
to the correspinding parameter of the function.
So any modifications on the parameter will not be reflected on that passed argument.
Sometimes we expect the modifications made in a function on a value
to be reflected to the outside of the function body,
then we can pass the address (a.k.a, a pointer) of the value to a pointer parameter of the function.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Book struct {
	Pages int
}

func DoublePageA(book Book) {
	// The modification on the parameter will not be
	// reflected to the outside of the function.
	book.Pages *= 2
}

func DoublePageB(book *Book) {
	// The modification on the value referenced by the parameter
	// will be reflected to the outside of the function.
	book.Pages *= 2

	// However, the modification on the parameter itself
	// will not be reflected to the outside of the function.
	book = nil
}

func main () {
	book := Book{Pages: 100}
	DoublePageA(book)
	fmt.Println(book.Pages) // still 100. (book is not modified in DoublePageA)
	p := &book
	DoublePageB(p)
	fmt.Println(book.Pages) // print 200. (book is modified in DoublePageB)
	fmt.Println(p == nil)   // print false. (p is not modified in DoublePageB)
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Some popular languages have not the pointer concept.
However, pointers are just hidden under other concepts in those languages.
</p>

<h3>Compisite Literals Are Unaddressable But Can Be Taken Addresses</h3>

<div>
Generally, only addressable values can be taken addresses.
But there is a syntax sugar in Go, which allows us to
take addesses on compisite literals.
A syntax sugar is an exception in syntax to make programming convinient.
For example,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		Pages int
	}
	p := &Book{100} // Book{100} is unaddressable but can be taken address
	p.Pages = 200
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Return Pointers Of Local Variables Is Safe In Go</h3>

<div>
Unlike C language, Go is a language supporting garbage collection,
so return an address of local allocated memory is absolutely safe in Go.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func newInt() *int {
	a := 3
	return &a
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Restrictions On Pointers In Go</h3>

<p>
For safety reasons,
Go makes some restrictions to guarantee pointers in Go are always legal and safe.
By applying these restrictions, Go keeps the benefits of pointers,
and avoids the dangerousness of pointers at the same time.
</p>

<h4>Poiner Values Don't Support Arithmetic Operations</h4>

<div>
<p>
In Go, pointers can't do arithmetic operations.
For a pointer value <code>p</code>, statement <code>p++</code> is illegal in Go.
If <code>p</code> is a pointer to a numeric value,
then <code>*v++</code> will be treated as <code>(*v)++</code> by Go compilers.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main () {
	a := int64(5)
	p := &a
	
	// The following two lines don't compile.
	/*
	p++
	p = (&a) + 8
	*/
	
	*p++
	fmt.Println(*p, a)   // 6 6
	fmt.Println(p == &a) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Converted To An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
In Go, a pointer value of pointer type <code>T1</code> can be directly converted
to another pointer type <code>T2</code> only if either of the following two conditions
is get satisfied.
<ol>
<li>
	The underlying types of type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are identical (ignoring struct tags),
	in particular if either <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> is an unnamed type
	and they underlying types are identical (considering struct tags),
	then the conversion can be implicit.
</li>
<li>
	Type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are both unnamed pointer types and
	the underlying types of their base types are identical.
</li>
</ol>

By example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type MyInt int64
type Ta    *int64
type Tb    *MyInt
</code></pre>

For the 4 pointer types shown above,
<ol>
<li>
	values of type <code>*int64</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>Ta</code>,
	and vice versa, for their underlying types are both <code>*int64</code>.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>*MyInt</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	and vice versa, for their underlying types are both <code>*MyInt</code>.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>*MyInt</code> can be explicitly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	and vice versa, for the underlying types of their base types are both <code>int64</code>
	and they are both unnamed.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>Ta</code> can't be directly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	even if explicitly.
	However, by the just listed first three facts, a value <code>pa</code> of
	type <code>Ta</code> can be indirectly converted to type <code>Tb</code>
	by nesting three explicit conversions, <code>Tb((*MyInt)((*int64)(pa)))</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
None of the 4 pointers can be converted to type <code>*uint64</code>, in any safe ways.
</p>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Compared With Values Of An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
In Go, pointers can be compared with <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.
Two Go pointer values can only be compared if either of the following three conditions
are satisified.
<ol>
<li>
	The types of the two Go pointers are identical.
</li>
<li>
	One pointer value can be implicitly converted to the pointer type of the other.
	In other words, the underlying types of the two types must be identical
	and either of the two types of the two Go pointers must be an unnamed type.
</li>
<li>
	One and only one of the two pointers is represented with the bare <code>nil</code> identifier.
</li>
</ol>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type MyInt int64
	type Ta    *int64
	type Tb    *MyInt
	
	// 4 nil pointers of different types.
	var pa0 Ta
	var pa1 *int64
	var pb0 Tb
	var pb1 *MyInt
	
	// The following 6 lines compile okay.
	// The comparison results are all true.
	_ = pa0 == pa1
	_ = pb0 == pb1
	_ = pa0 == nil
	_ = pa1 == nil
	_ = pb0 == nil
	_ = pb1 == nil
	
	// None of the following 3 lines compile.
	/*
	_ = pa0 == pb0
	_ = pa1 == pb1
	_ = pa0 == Tb(nil)
	*/
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Assigned To Another Value Of An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<p>
The conditions to assign a pointer value to another pointer value are the same as
the conditions to compare a pointer value to another pointer value,
which are listed above.
</p>

<h3>It's Possible To Break The Go Pointer Restrictions</h3>

<p>
As the start of this article has mentioned,
the mechanisms provided by <a href="unsafe.html">the
<code>unsafe</code> standard package</a>
can be used to break the restrictions made for pointers in Go.
But, generally, the unsafe ways are not recommended.
