<p>
Same as C language, Go also supports pointer values.
Go pointers and C pointers are much similar in may aspects,
but there are also some differences of pointers between Go and C.
This artcile will list all kinds of concepts and details related to pointers in Go.
</p>

<h3>Memory Addresses</h3>

<p>
A memory address means a distance (number of bytes) from the start point of the whole memory.
</p>

<p>
Generally, a memory address is stored as an unsigned native (interger) word.
The size of a native word is 4 (bytes) on 32-bit architectures and 8 (bytes)
on 64-bit architectures.
So the theoretical maximum memory space size is 2<sup>32</sup> bytes,
a.k.a. 4GB (1GB == 2<sup>30</sup> bytes), on 32-bit architectures,
and is 2<sup>34</sup>GB (16 exibytes) on 64-bit architectures.
</p>

<p>
Memory addresses are often represented with hex number form literally,
such as <code>0x1234CDEF</code>.
</p>

<h3>The Address Of A Value</h3>
<p>
At run time, many values are stored somewhere in memory.
Each of such values has a direct part, some of them have indirect parts.
Each value part will occupy a continuous memory segment.
<b>The address of such a value</b> means the start memory address of
the memory segment occupied by the direct part of the value.
</p>

<p><i>
(About which values may have indirect parts, you can read
<a href="underlying-values.html">Underlying Values In Go</a> for details later.)
</i></p>

<h3>What Are Pointers?</h3>

<p>
A pointer is a special value, which can storage a memory address,
Generally, the stored memory address is an address of another value.
In Go, for safety reason, there are some restrictions made for pointers.
Please read the following sections for details.
</p>

<p>
In daily programming, we often call an address as a pointer, and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>About The <code>unsafe</code> Standard Package</h3>

<p>
Unlike C, Go is a type safe language.
However, it is possible to do some type unsafe operations in Go,
through the mechanisms provided by the <code>unsafe</code> standard package.
This article will not explain the unsafe mechanisms,
<a href="unsafe.html">this article</a> will.
Here just to make a clarification that the following sections in this article
assume no unsafe ways are involved if not particularly indicated.
</p>

<h3>Go Pointer Types And Values</h3>

<p>
Same as C langauge, a pointer type can be represented with <code>*T</code>,
where <code>T</code> is an arbitrary type.
Type <code>T</code> is called the base type of pointer type <code>*T</code>.
</p>

<p>
If two unnamed pointer types have the same base type,
then they are the same type.
</p>

<p>
We can define named pointer types,
but generally this is not recommended.
Unnamed pointer types have better readabilities than named ones.
If the underlying type of a named pointer type is <code>*T</code>,
then the base type of the named pointer tyoe is <code>T</code>.
About what is underlying type,
please read <a href="type-system.html#underlying-type">this article</a>.
</p>

<p>
The value of a pointer type is called a pointer value,
particularly a value of a type whose underlying type is <code>*T</code>
can be called a <code>T</code> pointer.
</p>

<p>
The value located at the address stored in a pointer value of a type
whose underlying type is <code>*T</code> will be always viewed as
a value of type <code>T</code> by compilers.
</p>

<p>
Zero values of any pointer types are represented with <code>nil</code> literally.
No addresses are stored in <code>nil</code> pointer values.
</p>

<p>
Pointer types are all comparable types.
</p>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">*int  // A pointer type whose base type is int.
**int // A multi-level pointer type whose base type is a pointer type *int.
type IntPtr *int // IntPtr is a pointer type whose underlying type is *int.
                 // Its base type is int.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>How To Get A Pointer Value?</h3>

<p>
The built-in <code>new</code> function can be used to allocate memory for a value
of any type. <code>new(T)</code> will allocate memory for a <code>T</code> value
and return the address of the <code>T</code> value.
The allocated value is a zero value of type <code>T</code>.
The returned address can be viewed as a pointer value of type <code>*T</code>.
</p>

<p>
We can also take the address of an addressable value <code>t</code> of type <code>T</code>
with the expression <code>&amp;t</code>,
where <code>&amp;</code> is an operator to take value addresses.
The type of <code>&amp;t</code> can be viewed as a pointer value of type <code>*T</code>.
</p>

<p>
The address of a value can be stored in multiple pointers simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Examples of how to get pointer values will be shown in the next section.
</p>

<h3>Pointer Dereference</h3>

<p>
Given a pointer value <code>p</code> of type <code>T<sub>p</sub></code>,
how to get the value at the address stored in the pointer?
Just use the expression <code>*p</code>, where <code>*</code> is called dereference operator.
<code>*p</code> is call the dereference of poiner <code>p</code>.
The result of <code>*p</code> is a value of the base type of <code>T<sub>p</sub></code>.
</p>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	p0 := new(int)   // allocate memory
	fmt.Println(p0)  // a hex integer string
	fmt.Println(*p0) // dereference. Print 0.
	
	// x is a copy of the value at the address stored in p0.
	x := *p0
	p1 := &x // take address of x
	fmt.Printf("%T, %T \n", p0, p1) // *int, *int 
	fmt.Println(p0 == p1) // false
	
	p2 := &x // also take address of x
	fmt.Println(p1 == p2) // true
	
	p3 := &*p0
	fmt.Println(p0 == p3) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>About The Word "Reference"</h3>

<p>
The word <b><i>reference</i></b> in Go world is a big mess.
It brings many confusions to Go community.
Here this article tries to clarify the definition of this word.
</p>

<p>
In Go specification, the word <b><i>reference</i></b> indicates a relation.
It is either a verb or an action noun, instead of a qualifier.
For example, if a pointer value storages the address of another value,
then we can say the pointer value (directly) references the other value,
and the other value has at least one reference.
If a <a href="struct">struct</a>/<a href="golang-container.html">container</a>
value has a pointer field/element which references another value,
then we can also say the struct/container value references the other value, indirectly.
</p>

<h3>Why Do We Need Pointers?</h3>

<div>
Sometimes, a value needs to be referenced by multiple values simultaneously.
For example, for a binary tree data structure,
to perform all kinds of tree operations,
each parernt node needs to be referenced by its two children nodes
(and the two children nodes also needs to be referenced by that parent node).
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type TreeNode struct {
	parent *TreeNode
	left   *TreeNode
	right  *TreeNode
	// other data ...
}
</code></pre>

Each argument in a function call will be assigned (copied) to its correspinding parameter.
That argument and its correspinding parameter are two different values located at different addresses.
So any modifications on the parameter will not be reflected on that passed argument.
Sometimes we expect the modifications made by a function on a value
to be reflected to the outside of the function body,
then we can pass the address (a.k.a, a pointer) of the value to a pointer parameter of the function.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func DoubleA(x int) {
	// The modification on the parameter will not be
	// reflected to the outside of the function.
	x = 2 * x
}

func DoubleB(x *int) {
	// The modification on the referenced value will be
	// reflected to the outside of the function.
	*x = 2 * (*x)

	// However, the modification on the parameter itself
	// will not be reflected to the outside of the function.
	x = new(int)
}

func main () {
	a := 3
	DoubleA(a)
	fmt.Println(a) // 3
	p := &a
	DoubleB(p)
	fmt.Println(a) // 6
	fmt.Println(p == &a) // print true. 
	                     // p is not modified by the call to DoubleB.
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Some popular languages have not the pointer concept.
However, pointers are just hidden under other concepts (such as reference) in those languages.
</p>

<h3>Return Pointers Of Local Variables Is Safe In Go</h3>

<div>
Unlike C language, Go is a language supporting garbage collection,
so return an address of local allocated memory is absolutely safe in Go.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func newInt() *int {
	a := 3
	return &a
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Restrictions On Pointers In Go</h3>

<p>
For safety reasons,
Go makes some restrictions to guarantee pointers in Go are always legal and safe.
By applying these restrictions, Go keeps the benefits of pointers,
and avoids the dangerousness of pointers at the same time.
</p>

<h4>Poiner Values Don't Support Arithmetic Operations</h4>

<div>
<p>
In Go, pointers can't do arithmetic operations.
For a pointer value <code>p</code>, statement <code>p++</code> is illegal in Go.
If <code>p</code> is a pointer to a numeric value,
then <code>*v++</code> will be treated as <code>(*v)++</code> by Go compilers.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main () {
	a := int64(5)
	p := &a
	
	// The following two lines don't compile.
	/*
	p++
	p = (&a) + 8
	*/
	
	*p++
	fmt.Println(*p, a)   // 6 6
	fmt.Println(p == &a) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Converted To An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
In Go, a pointer value of pointer type <code>T1</code> can be directly converted
to another pointer type <code>T2</code> only if either of the following two conditions
is get satisfied.
<ol>
<li>
	The underlying types of type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are identical (ignoring struct tags),
	in particular if either <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> is an unnamed type
	and they underlying types are identical (considering struct tags),
	then the conversion can be implicit.
</li>
<li>
	Type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are both unnamed pointer types and
	the underlying types of their base types are identical.
</li>
</ol>

By example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type MyInt int64
type Ta    *int64
type Tb    *MyInt
</code></pre>

For the 4 pointer types shown above,
<ol>
<li>
	values of type <code>*int64</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>Ta</code>,
	and vice versa, for their underlying types are both <code>*int64</code>.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>*MyInt</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	and vice versa, for their underlying types are both <code>*MyInt</code>.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>*MyInt</code> can be explicitly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	and vice versa, for the underlying types of their base types are both <code>int64</code>
	and they are both unnamed.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>Ta</code> can't be directly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	even if explicitly.
	However, by the just listed first three facts, a value <code>pa</code> of
	type <code>Ta</code> can be indirectly converted to type <code>Tb</code>
	by nesting three explicit conversions, <code>Tb((*MyInt)((*int64)(pa)))</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
None of the 4 pointers can be converted to type <code>*uint64</code>, in any safe ways.
</p>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Compared With Values Of An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
In Go, pointers can be compared with <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.
Two Go pointer values can only be compared if either of the following three conditions
are satisified.
<ol>
<li>
	The types of the two Go pointers are identical.
</li>
<li>
	One pointer value can be implicitly converted to the pointer type of the other.
	In other words, the underlying types of the two types must be identical
	and either of the two types of the two Go pointers must be an unnamed type.
</li>
<li>
	One and only one of the two pointers is represented with the bare <code>nil</code> identifier.
</li>
</ol>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type MyInt int64
	type Ta    *int64
	type Tb    *MyInt
	
	// 4 nil pointers of different types.
	var pa0 Ta
	var pa1 *int64
	var pb0 Tb
	var pb1 *MyInt
	
	// The following 6 lines compile okay.
	// The comparison results are all true.
	_ = pa0 == pa1
	_ = pb0 == pb1
	_ = pa0 == nil
	_ = pa1 == nil
	_ = pb0 == nil
	_ = pb1 == nil
	
	// None of the following 3 lines compile.
	/*
	_ = pa0 == pb0
	_ = pa1 == pb1
	_ = pa0 == Tb(nil)
	*/
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Assigned To Another Value Of An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<p>
The conditions to assign a pointer value to another pointer value are the same as
the conditions to compare a pointer value to another pointer value,
which are listed above.
</p>

<h3>It's Possible To Break The Go Pointer Restrictions</h3>

<p>
As the start of this article has mentioned,
the mechanisms provided by the <code>unsafe</code> standard package
can be used to break the restrictions made for pointers in Go.
But, generally, the unsafe ways are not recommended.
