<h1>Memory Leaking</h1>

for a GC langauge, generally, there shouldn't be memory leaking.
But ...

We have learned that the syntax <code>aString[start:end]</code> to create a substring of <code>aString</code>.
In the official Go implementation,
when creating a substring from another string,
the substring and the other string will share the same underlying memory block allocated for underlying bytes,
even if the substring only use a small portion of the memory block.
Assume the memory block is only used by the two strings,
it will be only garbaged collected if both of the two strings are not reachable any more.

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"runtime"
	"strings"
)

var s0 string // package level variable

func f1() {
	bs := make([]byte, 1 << 20) // (1 << 20) is 1M
	
	s1 := string(bs) // The underlying byte sequence of s1 is
	                 // a copy of the underlying bytes of bs.
	s0 = s1[:1] // s0 only contains the first byte in s1.
	            // s0 and s1 share the same underlying bytes.
		     // In fact, even if len(s0) == 0, s0 will still
	            // share the same underlying bytes with s1.
}

func main() {
	f1()
	runtime.GC()

	// Up to now, the 1M bytes memory block allocated in f1 is
	// still not be GCed. The reason is the package level
	// variable s0 is still alive now, even if it only actually
	// uses one byte in the 1M memory block.
	
	// use any of these methods to avoid "memory leaking".
	s0 = strings.Repeat(s0, 1)
	s0 = string([]byte(s0))
	
	// todo: use strings.Builder to avoid one allocation.
	
	runtime.GC()
	// now, the 1M memory block is garbage collected.

<h3>Memory Leaking</h3>

<div>
Sometimes, a value only occupying a small portion of a memory block,
which prevents the memory block from being collected.
An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

var smallStr string

func f1(smallLen int) {
	longStr := string(make([]byte, 1 << 20))
	smallStr = longStr[0:smallLen]
	// For the offcial Go compiler, now smallStr shares
	// the same underlying byte sequence memory block
	// with longStr. After exiting this function, this
	// memory block is still referenced by smallStr,
	// even if smallLen is zero. This will prevent the
	// memory block being collected,
}

var aSlice []int

func f2(sliceLen int) {
	anArray := [10000]int{}
	aSlice = anArray[0:sliceLen]
	// anArray and the underlying element sequence are
	// hosted on the same memory block, so even if
	// there is no elements in aSlice, after exiting
	// this functions, the memory block hosting
	// anArray still can't be collected.
}

func main() {
	f1(0)
	f2(0)
	
	// ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
These are kind of memory leaking, not real memory leaking.
</p>
</div>

<div>
Setting a finalizer for a value which is a member of a cyclic reference group may
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">prevent all memory blocks allocated
for the cyclic reference group from being collected</a>.
This is real memory leaking, not kind of.
For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func memoryLeaking() {
	type T struct {
		v [1<<20]int
		t *T
	}

	var finalizer = func(t *T) {
		 fmt.Println("finalizer called")
	}
	
	var x, y T
	// SetFinalizer will make x escape to heap.
	// Following two lines combined will make
	// x and y not collectable.
	x.t, y.t = &y, &x // y also escapes to heap.
	runtime.SetFinalizer(&x, finalizer)
}
</code></pre>
