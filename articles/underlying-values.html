<h1>Underlying Values</h1>

<div>
Go types can be classified into two categories:
<ol>
<li>types each of whose values always has only one direct transparent part.
</li>
<li>types each of whose values may be composed of more than one parts,
	one direct part and one or several indirect underlying parts.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
For the offcial Go compiler,
the first category includes boolean, numeric, pointer, array and custom struct types,
and the second category includes map, slice, channel, function, string and interface types.
</p>

<p>
This article will introduce the internal definitions of types in the second category.
Knowing these structures is helpful not only in understanding
the functionalities of these types better,
but also in understanding some other concepts in Go programming.
</p>

<p>
The detailed implementations of these types will not be explained in this article.
</p>

<p>
Before we get to the main point, let's clear up what are pointers and pointer wrappers.
</p>


<!---

* when we say the address of a value, we mean the address of .. is the address of the direct part.
* the indirect parts of map/chanel/functin may reference other more indirect parts.
* only bool, numeric, pointer, array and struct types are essential types for a languages.
  other types (whose values many have underlying values) are just to make
  programming enjoyable and unique,

<h3>Pointers And Pointer Wrappers</h3>

<p>
As a C-family language, pointer types play important role in Go.
A pointer value stores a memory address of another value,
unless the pointer value is a <code>nil</code> pointer.
We can say the other value is referenced (or pointed) by the pointer value.
</p>

<p>
For a pointer value, <code>p</code>, <code>*p</code> is called dereference of <cpde>p</cpde>.
The result of the dereference of <code>p</code> is the value referenced by <code>p</code>.
</p>

<p>
For a pointer type <code>*T</code>,
its non-nil values can only reference values of type <code>T</code>.
In other words, its non-nil values can only store the addresses of values of type <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type is a special pointer type in Go.
It is like <code>void*</code> in C language.
As its package name implies, it is dangerous and
not recommended to be used in general Go programming.
It is mainly used in Go runtime internal.
</p>

<p>
A struct type with pointer fields can be called a pointer wrapper type.
If the struct type has no other non-pointer fields,
it is called a pure pointer wrapper type,
otherwise, it is called a hybrid pointer wrapper type.
If any pointer field of a pointer wrapper value references another value,
then we can also say the pointer wrapper value references the other value.
</p>

<p>
A struct type with pointer wrapper fields is
also viewed as a pointer wrapper type.
</p>

<p><i>
(BTW, the definition of the word <b>reference</b> is shown at the end of this article.
We can think it means "point to" temporarily.)
</i></p>

<h3>Types Whose Values May Have Indirect Underlying Parts</h3>

<div>
As above has mentioned, values of following types (type families) in Go
may be composed of more than one parts:
<ul>
<li>map types.</li>
<li>channel types.</li>
<li>function types.</li>
<li>slice types.</li>
<li>interface types.</li>
<li>string types.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These built-in types bring much convenience to Go programming
and make Go programming productive and enjoyable,
by encapsulating some common or unique functionalities.
On the other hand, these encapsulations hide the internal definitions of these types,
which prevents Go programmers from viewing the whole pictures of these types.
So here will list the internal definitions of such types,
to make Go programmers understand these types better.
</p>
</div>

<p><i>
(The explanations in this article are based on, but not exactly same as,
the implementations by the official Go compiler.)
</i></p>

<h4>Internal Definitions Of Map, Channel And Function Types</h4>

<div>
The internal definitions of map, channel and function types are similar:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// map
type _map *hashtable // currently, for the official Go compiler,
                     // Go maps are hashtables actually.

// channel
type _channel *channelImpl

// function
type _function *functionImpl
</code></pre>
<p>
So, internally, types of the three families are just pointer types.
The zero values of these types are all represented by <code>nil</code> identifier literally.
For any non-nil value of these types,
its direct part (a pointer) points its indirect underlying implementation part.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the indirect underlying part of a value of any channel or function type
may also reference deeper indirect underlying parts.
But this article views the deeper ones and first level indirect one
as one whole indirect part.
</p>

<p><i>
(Although these types are represented by pointer types internally,
Go runtimes will never think they are pointer types in user programs.)
</i></p>
</div>

<h4>Internal Definition Of Slice Types</h4>

<div>
The internal definition of slice types is like:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// slice
struct {
	elements unsafe.Pointer
	len      int // number of elements
	cap      int // capacity
}
</code></pre>
<p>
So, internally, slice types are hybrid pointer wrapper types.
The zero values of slice types are also represented by <code>nil</code> identifier literally.
Each non-nil slice value has an indirect underlying part which stores element values
of the slice value. The <code>elements</code> field of the direct part
stores the starting address of the indirect underlying part of the slice value.
</p>
</div>

<p><i>
(The indirect part of a slice value may be an array created explicitly.
Viewing the indirect part as underlying may be not very suitable.
But for wording consistency, this article will still view
such indirect parts as underlying parts below.)
</i></p>

<h4>Internal Definition Of String Types</h4>

<div>
Below is the internal definition for string types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// string
struct {
	elements *byte // strings can be viewed as byte containers.
	len      int   // number of bytes
}
</code></pre>
<p>
So string types are also hybrid pointer wrapper types internally.
The zero values of string types are blank strings, which are represented by
<code>""</code> or <code>``</code> literals.
Each string value has an indirect underlying part storing
the bytes of the string value, the indirect part is referenced
by <code>elements</code> field of that string value.
</p>
</div>

<p><i>
(For the official Go runtime,
<a href="unofficial-faq.html#zero-values-zero-bytes">a blank string may have
an underlying part, or not</a>.)
</i></p>

<p class="anchor" id="interface-structure"></p>
<h4>Internal Definition Of Interface Types</h4>

<div>
Below is the internal definition for interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// interface
struct {
	dynamicTypeInfo *struct {
		itype   *_type   // the interface type.
		dtype   *_type   // the dynamic type, which implements itype.
		methods []*_func // implemented methods of dtype for itype.
	}
	dynamicValuePtr unsafe.Pointer // points to the dynamic value
}
</code></pre>
<p>
It looks the internal definition of interface types are a little more complex.
It has two pointer fields.
The zero values of slice types are also represented by <code>nil</code> identifier literally.
Each non-nil interface value has an indirect underlying part which stores the dynamic value
of that interface value. The indirect part is referenced by the <code>dynamicValuePtr</code>
field of that interface value.
</p>

<p>
Each non-nil interface value also has an indirect underlying part which stores the dynamic type
information of that interface value. This indirect part is referenced by the
<code>dynamicTypeInfo</code> field of that interface value.
The dynamic type information is stored in a runtime global region.
Go runtime will create most one dynamic type information struct for each (itype, dtype) pair.
A dynamic type information struct will be never garbaged collected once it is created.
For this specialty, it will not be viewed as an underlying part of the interface value
any more in below part of this article.
In other words, following of this article will think each interface value
has most one underlying part, so that, any value of above shown internal definitions
in this article has most one underlying part.
</p>
</div>

<div>
As the blank interface type <code>interface{}</code> is used popular in Go programming,
the official Go compiler uses a different and more efficient underlying definition for
blank interface types than non-blank interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// blank interface
struct {
	dynamicType     *_type         // the dynamic type
	dynamicValuePtr unsafe.Pointer // points to the dynamic value
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><i>
(If the dynamic value of an interface value is pointer, then the official Go compiler
will make an optimization here, by storing the pointer value in the
<Code>dynamicValuePtr</Code> field of the interface value directly.)
</i></p>

<h3>Underlying Parts Are Not Copied In Value Assignments</h3>

<p>
In Go, each assignment (including parameter passing, etc) is a shallow value copying
if the involved destination and source values have the same type
(if their types are different, the source value will be converted to the destination
type before making that assignment).
This means in a pointer or pointer wrapper value assignment,
only the memory address(es) of the referenced value(s) are copied,
the indirect referenced value(s) will not be copied.
In other words, the destination pointer or pointer wrapper value will reference
the same indirect values referenced by the source pointer or pointer wrapper value
after the assignment.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the above statement is not 100% correct in theory.
The <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#pass_by_value">official Go FAQ</a> says 
copying an interface value will copy its underlying dynamic value part.
However, as the dynamic value of an interface value is read only,
the official Go compiler/runtime doesn't copy the underlying dynamic value part in the copying.
This can be viewed as a compiler optimization.
The same situation is for string values and the same optimization is made for
copying string values, by the official Go compiler/runtime.
In other words, for the official Go compiler/runtime,
the indirect underlying parts will never be copied for any value copying.
</p>

<p>
Since an indirect underlying part may not belong to any value exclusively,
it doesn't contribute to the size returned by the <code>unsafe.Sizeof</code> function.
</p>

<h3>About The Word "Reference"</h3>

<p>
The word <b><i>reference</i></b> in Go world is a big mess.
It brings many confusions to Go community.
Here this article tries to clarify the definition of this word.
</p>

<p>
In Go specification, the word <b><i>reference</i></b> indicates a relation.
It is either a verb or an action noun, instead of a qualifier.
For example, if a pointer value stores the address of another value,
then we can say the pointer value references the other value,
and the other value has at least one reference.
If a struct/container value has a pointer field/element which references another value,
then we can also say the struct/container value references the other value.
</p>

<div>
Some articles, including some <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#references">official ones</a>,
use <b><i>reference</i></b> as qualifiers of types and values, or treat <b><i>reference</i></b>
as the opposite of <b><i>value</i></b>. This is strongly not recommended.
I really don't want to dispute on this point.
Here I just list some absolutely misuses of <b><i>reference</i></b>:
<ul>
<li>only slice, map, channel and function types are reference types in Go.
	(If we do need the <b><i>reference type</i></b> terminology in Go,
	then we shouldn't exclude any custom pointer and pointer wrapper types
	from reference types).
</li>
<li>references as opposites of values.
	(If we do need the <b><i>reference value</i></b> terminology in Go,
	then please view reference values as special values, instead of
	opposites of values.)
</li>
<li>some parameters are passed by reference.
	(Sorry, all parameters are passed by copy in Go.)
</li>
</ul>
<!---
dont't use the phase "pass by value" either.
-->

<p>
I don't mean the <b><i>reference type</i></b> or <b><i>reference value</i></b>
terminologies are totally useless for Go,
I just think they are not very essential.
If we do need these terminologies, I prefer to define them as
pointers and pointer wrappers.
However, my personal opinion is to limit the <b><i>reference</i></b>
word to representing relations, and never use it as qualifiers.
This will avoid many confusions in leaning, teaching and using Go.
</p>
</div>

<!---

referenece
* not only pointer and pointer wrapper, is [5]*int referecne type?
so give a clear reference definition is hard.
and the benefit is not large, the effect is even negative.
So it is not essential.

<hr>

<p>
Some documentations and articles use the<b><i>reference type</i></b>
and <code>reference value</code> terminologies and think
map, slice, function and channel types are the only four kinds of reference types in Go.
This is strongly 
</p>

<h3>Reference Types And Reference Values</h3>

<p>
In the Go 101 article series, the definition of reference type is very clear.
<b>Reference types are just pointer types,
and only pointer types can be called reference types</b>.
</p>

<p>
Go 101 doesn't attempt to make a definition for <b>reference values</b>.
For I think it is not essential to make such a definition,
and making a precise definition for <b>reference values</b> is hard,
and even a prefise <b>reference value</b> definition amy still cause confusions.
An imperfect definition will bring many confusions to the Go community.
Knowing about all aspects of Go pointers is enough ...
</p>
