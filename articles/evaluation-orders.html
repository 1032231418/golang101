<h1>Expression Evaluation Orders</h1>

<p>
This article will explain <a href="expressions-and-statements.html">expression</a>
evaluation orders in all kinds of scenarios.
</p>

<h3>The Usual Order</h3>

<div>
<p>
Before learning expression evaluation orders under all kinds of scenarios,
let's learn what is <b><i>the usual order</i></b>.
</p>

Go specification doesn't describe much on what is the usual order.
From the examples provided in Go specification,
I think the the usual order means, in a statement,
<ul>
<li>
	an <a href="expressions-and-statements.html#expressions">expression</a>
	is evaluated after the evaluations of its sub-expressions.
	(The expression depends on its sub-expressions.)
</li>
<li>
	function calls, method calls and channel receive operations
	which have no dependency relations with each other
	are evaluated by their lexical left-to-right and up-to-down order.
	(Function call, method call and channel receive operation
	are several kinds of expressions.)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The evaluation order of other kinds of expressions which have no
dependency relations with each other in a statement is not specified.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Evaluation Orders In <code>=</code> Assignments</h3>

<div>
<p>
We know that multiple values can be assigned in one assignment in Go.
Each left-hand side item in a <code>=</code> assignment must be addressable,
a map index expression, or the blank identifier.
In most cases, we don't need to care about the evaluation order rules
of the expressions involved in multi-valued assignments.
But for some special cases, we really should understand the rules
to know the assignment results clearly.
</p>

<p>
Each assignment will experience two phases at run time,
the preparation phase and the carry-out phase.
At the preparation phase, all expressions involved in that assignment
are evaluated in the usual order mentioned above.
</p>

Just after the preparation phase and before the carry-out phase of an assignment,
the assignment is rewritten as the following elementary form:

<pre><code class="language-go">L0, L1, ..., Ln = R0, R1, ..., Rn
</code></pre>

where each <code>Lx</code> may be
<ul>
<li>
	the blank identifier <code>_</code>,
	if the corresponding left side item is also the blank identifier.
</li>
<li>
	a form of <code>*Px</code>, if the corresponding left side item
	is neither a map index expression nor the blank identifier.
	<code>Px</code> is a (pointer) value of any pointer type.
</li>
<li>
	a form of <code>(*PMx)[Kx]</code>,
	if the corresponding left side item is a map index expression.
	<code>PMx</code> is a (pointer) value of a pointer type
	which base type is a map type and <code>Kx</code> is a value
	of the key type of the map type.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and, every <code>Px</code>, <code>PMx</code>, <code>Kx</code> and
<code>Rx</code> is an elementary value which can't be evaluated further.
They are all hidden temporary values which are only referenced
in the elementary form of the assignment.
</p>

<p>
In the carry-out phase, solo assignments, <code>L0 = R0</code>,
<code>L1 = R1</code>, ..., <code>Ln = Rn</code>,
are carried out in left-to-right order.
<p/>

For example, in the following assignment, at the preparation phase,
the evaluations of <code>f()</code>, <code>h()</code>, <code>i()</code>,
<code>j()</code>, <code>&lt;-c</code>, <code>g()</code>, and <code>k()</code>
happen in lexical left-to-right order.

<pre><code class="language-go">y[f()], ok = g(h(), i()+x[j()], <-c), k()
</code></pre>

<p>
By the dependency relations, the evluation of the container element indexing
expression <code>x[]</code> should happen between the evluations of
the function calls <code>j()</code> and <code>g()</code>.
</p>

<p>
The relative evaluation order of <code>y</code> and any other expression
in the above assignment is not specified.
The evaluation of <code>x</code> happens before <code>g()</code>
and <code>k()</code> for sure, but the relative evaluation order of
<code>x</code> and <code>&lt;-c</code> (or <code>f()</code>, <code>h()</code>,
<code>i()</code>, <code>j()</code>) is not specified.
</p>

In the following example, the relative order of the expression
<code>x+1</code> and <code>f(&x)</code> is not specified.
The example may output <code>100 99</code> or <code>1 99</code>.


<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	f := func (p *int) int {
		*p = 99
		return *p
	}
	
	x := 0
	y, z := x+1, f(&x)
	fmt.Println(y, z)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Assume <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are two addressable
elementary values, the following assignment

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	a, b = b, a
</code></pre>

will go through the the following two phases.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The preparation phase:
P0 := &a; P1 := &b
R0 := a; R1 := b

// The elementary form: *P0, *P1 = R0, R1

// The carry-out phase:
*P0 = R0
*P1 = R1
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following is another example, in which <code>x[0]</code> instead of
<code>x[1]</code> is modified.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	x := []int{0, 0}
	i := 0
	i, x[i] = 1, 2
	fmt.Println(x) // [2 0]
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

A example which is a little complex.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	m := map[string]int{"Go": 0}
	s := []int{1, 1, 1}; olds := s
	n := 2
	p := &n
	s, m["Go"], *p, s[n] = []int{2, 2, 2}, s[1], m["Go"], 5
	fmt.Println(m, s, n) // map[Go:1] [2 2 2] 0
	fmt.Println(olds)    // [1 1 5]
}
</code></pre>

The phases for the assignment at line <i>10</i> are shown below.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The preparation phase:
P0 := &s; PM1 := &m; K1 := "Go"; P2 := p; P3 := &s[2]
R0 := []int{2, 2, 2}; R1 := s[1]; R2 := m["Go"]; R3 := 5
// now, R1 == 1, R2 == 0

// The elementary form: *P0, (*PM1)[K1], *P2, *P3 = R0, R1, R2, R3

// The carry-out phase:
*P0 = R0
(*PM1)[K1] = R1
*P2 = R2
*P3 = R3
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following example rotates all elements in a slice for one index.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	x := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
	t := x[0]
	var i int
	for i, x[i] = range x {}
	x[i] = t
	fmt.Println(x) // [3 5 7 11 2]
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The last example in this section:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	x := []int{123}
	x, x[0] = nil, 456        // will not panic
	x, x[0] = []int{123}, 789 // will panic
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Evaluation Orders In <code>op=</code> Assignments</h3>

<p>
The expression evaluation rules of an assignment <code>x op= y</code>
is almost the same as the general assignment <code>x = x op y</code>.
The only difference is the expression <code>x</code> is only evaluated once.
<p>

<p>
Both the left- and right-hand expression lists of an <code>op=</code> assignment
must contain exactly one single-valued expression,
and the left-hand expression must not be the blank identifier.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation Orders In composite Literals</h3>

<div>

The expressions in a composite literal are evaluated in the usual order
mentioned above.
Several examples from Go specification:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	a := 1
	f := func() int { a++; return a }

	// x may be [1, 2] or [2, 2]: evaluation order 
	// between a and f() is not specified.
	x := []int{a, f()}

	// m may be {2: 1} or {2: 2}: evaluation order
	// between the two map assignments is not specified.
	m := map[int]int{a: 1, a: 2}

	// n may be {2: 3} or {3: 3}: evaluation order
	// between the key and the value is not specified.
	n := map[int]int{a: f()}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Evaluation Orders Of Function Arguments</h3>

<div>

<p>
The expressions in the argument list of a function call
are evaluated in the usual order mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
For example, in the following example, the first argument, <code>f()</code>,
of the function call <code>fmt.Println()</code> is guaranteed to be evaluated
before the last <code>f()</code>. But the relative evaluation order
of the second argument <code>y</code> and the two <code>f()</code>
is not specified.
<p>

<code>1 7 2</code>, <code>1 8 2</code> and <code>1 9 2</code> are
all legal outputs for the following program.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x, y := 0, 7
	f := func() int {
		x++
		y++
		return x
	}
	fmt.Println(f(), y, f())
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Expression Evaluation Orders In <code>switch-case</code> Code Blocks</h3>

<div>

The expression evaluation order in a <code>switch-case</code> code block
has been <a href="control-flows.html#switch-case">described before</a>.
Here just shows an example.
Simply speaking, before a branch is entered,
the expressions in a <code>switch-case</code> code block
are evaluated in source order.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	f := func(n int) int {
		fmt.Printf("f(%v) is called.\n", n)
		return n
	}
	
	switch x := f(3); x + f(4) {
	default:
	case f(5):
	case f(6), f(7), f(8):
	case f(9), f(10):
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
At run time, the <code>f()</code> calls will be evaluated by the order
from top to bottom and from left to right,
until a comparison results <code>true</code>.
So <code>f(8)</code>, <code>f(9)</code> and <code>f(10)</code>
will be not evaluated in this example.
</p>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>f(3) is called.
f(4) is called.
f(5) is called.
f(6) is called.
f(7) is called.
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Expression Evaluation Orders In <code>select-case</code> Code Blocks</h3>

<div>

<p>
For all the cases in a <code>select-case</code> code block,
the channel operands of receive operations and the channel and
right-hand-side expressions of send statements are evaluated exactly once,
in source order, upon starting executing the <code>select</code> statement.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the <code>select-case</code> code block will make
the current goroutine enter blocking state, or which branch is selected,
doesn't affect the just described expression evaluation order rule.
</p>

<p>
The left-hand-side expression of each receive statement will not be evaluated
before executing the <code>select</code> statement.
It will be evaluated if that receive statement is selected later.
The left-hand-side expressions of the unselected receive statements
will never be evaluated.
</p>

In the following example, the calls <code>fp("abc")</code>
and <code>fp("def")</code> will never be evaluated.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fc := func(info string) chan int {
		fmt.Println("fc:", info)
		c := make(chan int, 1)
		c <- 456
		return c
	}
	fv := func(n int) int {
		fmt.Println("fv:", n)
		return n
	}
	fp := func(info string) *int {
		fmt.Println("fp:", info)
		return new(int)
	}
	
	select {
	case *fp("abc") = <-fc("ijk"):
	case fc("pqr") <- fv(123):
	case fc("xyz") <- fv(789):
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output of the above program:
<pre class="output"><code>fc: ijk
fc: pqr
fv: 123
fc: xyz
fv: 789
fp: abc
</code></pre>

<p>
If the first case is never selected in the above example,
then the expression <code>*fp("abc")</code> will never get evaluated.
</p>

</div>
