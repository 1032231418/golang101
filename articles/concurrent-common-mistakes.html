<h2>Some Common Concurrent Programming Mistakes</h2>

<p>
Go is a language supporting concurrent programming natively.
By using the <code>go</code> keyword,
it is intuitive and convenient and to create new green threads,
a.k.a., goroutines.
To avoid data races in concurrent programming,
Go provides several technolodgies to do synchronizations among goroutines.
These technolodgies are introduced in
<a href="channel.html">Go channel concepts and rules</a>,
<a href="channel-use-cases.html">channel use cases</a> and
<a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html">more concurrency synchronization technolodgies</a>.
</p>

<p>
This article will show some common mistakes in Go concurrent programming,
including some improper uses of all kinds of synchronization methods.
</p>

<h3>No Synchronizations When Synchronizations Are Needed</h3>

Go <a href="memory-model.html">memory model</a>

var a []int = nil
f1() {
	a = []int{1, 2, 3}
	b = true
}

f2() {
	if b {
		// The assertion "a != nil" may fail,
		// though often the condition is really true.
		fmt.Println(a[0])
	}
}

The example takes two mistakes.
Firstly, the read of <code>b</code> is goroutine <code>f2</code>
and the write of <code>b</code> in goroutine <code>f1</code> would cause data race.
Secondly, the condition <code>b == true</code> can't assure that <code>a != nil</code>,
for compilers or CPU may make optimizations for function <code>f1</code> so that
the assignment of <code>b</code> may happen before the assignment of <code>a</code>.

* compare nil with interface values which dynamic value is nil non-interface value
* := and scope, particully, when return results have names.
* for i: go func() {use i} ....

=========================== send values to nil channel

var r = chan int32
go func() {
	r <- longTimeRequest() // block for ever
}()

==========================

func longTimeRequest() <-chan int32 {
	var r = make(chan int32)
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
		r <- rand.Int31n(100)
	}()
	return r
}

func subSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	fmt.Println(subSquares(<-longTimeRequest(), <-longTimeRequest()))
	
	// should be this:
	var ra = longTimeRequest()
	var rb = longTimeRequest()
	fmt.Println(<-ra, <-rb)
}


===================

* make sure every goroutine will not hang for ever
* if a channel will never be closed, be careful when 
  using bare <code><-ch</code> or <code>ch<-v</code> for it.
* if a channel will never be closed, if bare <code>ch<-v</code> is used, 
  make sure the sender will not send more and read all values out of the channel in the end.
* it is recommended to close every channel and read every values out of channels.



time.AfterFunc be careful memory leak

======================

first return wins case: the channel should has a capacity one.

============= close channels at the receiver side

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/26558


================ non-last-sender close channel



================ memory leak: goroutine block for ever, lost goroutines

================ atomic 64 bit, embeded, on 32-bit OS

================ select case send to closed channel

================= wait group wait before add.

================= memory model

=============== x is sunced, but fotget to sync x.y

================ channel assignment is not synced

================

for val := range values {
	go func() {
		fmt.Println(val)
	}()
}

for val := range values {
	go val.MyMethod()
}


============================

sync.Timer, Ticker.Reset

===================== goroutine may be never collected.

timeout := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	timeout <- struct{}{}
}()

select {
case <- data:
case <- timeout:
}

===================================

for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
	go func() {
		// use i
	}()
}

================== call cond.Notify and cond.Broadcase without accquiring a lock

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36857167/how-to-correctly-use-sync-cond

it is both ok to put the cond.Notify and cond.Broadcase
bwtween lock and unlock, or after the unlock.


=============== RWMutex deadlock

The lock goroutine queue
the rlock goroutine queue

a Unlock call can unblock both a goroutine in the lock or a rlock queue,
but rlock one has prority.
a RUnlock call will unblock a goroutine in lock queue in priroty.

package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    m := sync.RWMutex{}
    c := make(chan struct{})
    
    fa := func() {
	    m.Lock()
	    fmt.Println("a")
	    m.Unlock()
    }
    
    fb := func() {
	    time.Sleep(time.Second)
	    m.RLock()
	    fmt.Println("b")
	    <-c
	    m.RUnlock()
    }
    
    fc := func() {
	    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	    m.RLock()
	    fmt.Println("c")
	    c <- struct{}{}
	    m.RUnlock()
    }
    
    m.Lock()
    go fa()
    go fb()
    go fc()
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
    m.Unlock()
    
    select{}
}

================ copy snyc.XXX

<p>
Some princinples:
* know clearly whether a goroutine will exit or not.
  * know clearly how/when a goroutine will exit.
* avoid goroutine exited by unexpected panic.
  * avoid unintended sending data to closed channels.
  * use defer/recover to restart ...
</p>

Experienced gophers all know that there are three value synchronization technologies: 
mutex, atomic and channel. 
Mutex and atomic are often used in object property getter and setter methods. 
Althought the usage of mutex is simple, but it is not easy to use it without any mistakes.
</p>

<p>
<i>(All pointer values are assumed not nil in this article.)</i>
</p>

<div>
Let's start with the most simplest mistake: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T struct {
	sync.RWMutex
	a, b int // b is just for examples
}

func (t T) AB() int {
	// here t is a copy of T value, 
	// so t.RWMutex is also a copy.
	// W
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
The mistake is that mutex values should not be copied, which is stated in Go spec clearly.
</div>

<div>
Ok, let's change the mutex field into a pointer one: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T struct {
	*sync.RWMutex
	a, b int
}

func (t T) AB() int {
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
This above example is verified by govet, but the synchronization in AB method is totally meaningless. 
Even if the passed receiver is a singleton, the synchronization is still meaningless.
The reason is, although t.a is synchronized, but t itself is not synchronized. 
This can be easily proved by the following simple program: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "sync"
import "time"
import "log"

type T struct {
	*sync.RWMutex
	a, b int
}

func (t T) AB() int {
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	if t.a != t.b {
		log.Fatalln("a != b") // very possible exit here.
	}
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	time.Sleep(time.Microsecond)
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	const NLoops = 100
	var wg = sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(NLoops + NLoops)
	
	var t = T{&sync.RWMutex{}, 0, 0}
	
	for i := range [NLoops]struct{}{} {
		go func(i int) {
			t.SetAB(i)
			wg.Done()
		}(i)
	}
	
	for range [NLoops]struct{}{} {
		go func() {
			t.AB()
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	
	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
So we should always define synchronization methods on pointer types 
instead of non-pointer types: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T struct {
	sync.RWMutex
	a, b int
}

func (t *T) AB() int {
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
Done? Partially.
