<h1>Some Common Concurrent Programming Mistakes</h1>

<p>
Go is a language supporting concurrent programming natively.
By using the <code>go</code> keyword,
it is intuitive and convenient and to create new green threads,
a.k.a., goroutines.
To avoid data races in concurrent programming,
Go provides several techniques to do synchronizations among goroutines.
These techniques are introduced in
<a href="channel.html">Go channel concepts and rules</a>,
<a href="channel-use-cases.html">channel use cases</a> and
<a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html">more concurrency synchronization techniques</a>.
</p>

<p>
This article will show some common mistakes in Go concurrent programming,
including some improper uses of all kinds of synchronization methods.
</p>

<h3>No Synchronizations When Synchronizations Are Needed</h3>

<div>
The novice mistakes:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import (
	"time"
	"runtime"
)

func f() {
	var a []int = nil
	var b bool

	// goroutine 1
	go func () {
		a = make([]int, 3)
		b = true
	}()

	// goroutine 2
	go func() {
		for !b {
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
			runtime.Gosched()
		}
		
		a[0], a[1], a[2] = 0, 1, 2 // might panic
	}()
}
</code></pre>

There are two mistakes in this example.
<ol>
<li>
	First, the read of <code>b</code> in goroutine 2
	and the write of <code>b</code> in goroutine 1 might cause data race.
</li>
<li>
	Second, the condition <code>b == true</code> can't assure
	that <code>a != nil</code> in goroutine 2.
	Compilers or CPUs may make optimizations by
	<a href="/article/memory-model.html">reordering instructions</a> in goroutine 1,
	so the assignment of <code>b</code> may happen
	before the assignment of <code>a</code> at run time,
	which makes that <code>a</code> is still <code>nil</code>
	when modifying its elements in goroutine 2.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
We should use channels or the synchronization techniques provided in
the <code>sync</code> standard package to assure the memory orders.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Isolated Stuck Goroutines</h3>

<div>
An isolated stuck goroutine is a goroutine which will stay in blocking state for ever.
Such as
<ul>
<li>
	a straving goroutine trying to receive a value from a channel,
	but no other goroutines will send values to the channel any more.
</li>
<li>
	a goroutine trying to send a value to a channel,
	but no other goroutines will receive values from the channel any more.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such stuck goroutines become useless since they enter blocking state.
It is hard to detect whether or not a goroutine is stuck at run time,
so stuck goroutines will not be garbage collected and
they will still consume the memory resource allocated for them, for ever.
</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "sync"

type Counter struct {
	m sync.Mutex
	n uint64
}

func (c *Counter) Add(delta uint64) {
	c.m.Lock()
	c.n += delta
	c.m.Unlock()
}

func (c *Counter) Value() uint64 {
	c.m.Lock()
	defer c.m.Unlock()
	return c.n
}

func main() {
	var done = make(chan struct{})
	var c Counter
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		go func() {
			c.Add(1)
			if c.Value() == 100 {
				done <- struct{}{}
				
				/*
				select {
				default:
				case done <- struct{}{}:
				}
				*/
			}
		}()
	}
	<- done
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">
// send values to nil channel

var r = chan int32
go func() {
	r <- longTimeRequest() // block for ever
}()
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Close Channels Wihtout Acknowledging All Of Its Senders</h3>

<div>

<p>
<b>A send to a closed channel will panic.</b>
So if a sender (a goroutine) of a closed channel doesn't know the channel is already closed,
then the sender goroutine might continue sending values to the channel,
which will make the sender goroutine panic.
</p>

The most common case of this mistake is closing a channel from the receiver side.
Here is one example which makes this mistake:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	c := make(chan int)
	
	// senders
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		i := i
		go func() {
			for k := 0; k < 100; k++ {
				c <- i * k // panic if c is closed
			}
		}()
	}
	
	// receiver
	go func() {
		sum := 0
		for n := range c {
			sum += n
			if sum > 10000 {
				close(c) // without acknowledging senders
				break
			}
		}
	}()
}
</code></pre>

todo: need more examples
* non-last-sender close channel

<p>
The close in the receiver goroutine is very possible to cause panics in the sender goroutines.
The mistake is even often made in some famous projects, such as
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45291/files?diff=split">the</a>
two
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39479/files?diff=split">bugs</a>
in the kubernetes project.
</p>

Please note, a send operation on a closed channel is viewed as non-blocking operation.
So if such an operation is used as a <code>case</code> operation
in a <code>select</code> code block, it may caused a panic or not.
For example, the following program may panic or not.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	c := make(chan struct{})
	close(c)
	select {
	case c <- struct{}{}: // panic if this case gets selected.
	case <-c:             // not panic if this one is selected.
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
For the readom reason, such bugs may be not found as early as possible.
</p>

<p>
Like send to a closed channel, <b>close a closed channel will also panic</b>.

please read <a href="channel-closing.html">how to gracefully close channels</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Assign Channel Values Without Syncronizations</h3>

<p>
Many channel related operations are already synchronized,
so no further synchronizations are needed for these operations.
but like other kinds of values, channel value assignments are also not synchronized.
</p>

<h3>Too Late To Call The <code>Add</code> Method On A <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> Value</h3>

<p>
Each <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value maintains a counter internally.
We can call the <code>Add</code> method on a <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value
to change the value of the counter maintained by the <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value.
A <code>Done()</code> method call on a <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value
is just a shortcut of a <code>Add(-1)</code> on the <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value.
The counters should be never negative. If such a counter becomes negative, panic will happen.
</p>

<p>
A goroutine can call the <code>Wait</code> method on a <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value
to wait the counter maintained by the <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value becomes zero.
If the counter is already zero when the <code>Wait</code> method is called,
the call can be viewed as a no-op and the caller goroutine will not enter blocking state.
</p>

so
* don't miss Done calls
* don't make abundant  Done calls

<p>
So to make a the <code>Wait</code> method call take effect, a <code>Add</code> method call
with a positive argument should happen before
</p>

If the <code>Add</code> method (with a pos) on a <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value,

var wg sync.WaitGroup
for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
	i := i
	// wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		wg.Add(1)
		values[i] = 50 + rand.Int31n(50)
		fmt.Println("Done: ", i)
		wg.Done() // <=> wg.Add(-1)
	}()
}

wg.Wait()

<h3>Call 64-bit Atomic Functions On Possible Non-64-bit Aligned Values</h3>

<h3>Block Goroutines For Ever</h3>

memory leak 

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">
timeout := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	timeout <- struct{}{}
}()

select {
case <- data:
case <- timeout:
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Miss Channel Sends</h3>

first return wins case: the channel should has a capacity one.

<h3>Define Methods With Both Pointer And Non-Pointer Receivers For A Type</h3>

This is not always a mistake/
But synchronizations are needed to make for the values of the type,
then it is best not to mix method definitions with pointer and non-pointer receivers for the type.

receiver argument will be copied, ...

<h3>Not Pay Attention To The Variable Evaludation Timing</h3>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
	go func() {
		// use i
	}()
}
		
for val := range values {
	go func() {
		fmt.Println(val)
	}()
}

for val := range values {
	go val.MyMethod()
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Make Partial Syncrhronizations</h3>

x is synced, but fotget to sync x.y

<h3>Make Asymmetric Syncrhronizations</h3>

<h3>Copy Values Of The Types In The <code>sync</code> Standard Package</h3>

<h3>Call The <code>Notify</code> And <code>Broadcast</code> Methods Without Accquiring A Lock</h3>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36857167/how-to-correctly-use-sync-cond

it is both ok to put the cond.Notify and cond.Broadcase
bwtween lock and unlock, or after the unlock.

<h3>Deadlock Among Goroutines When Using <code>sync.Mutex</code> And <code>sync.RWMutex</code></h3>



The lock goroutine queue
the rlock goroutine queue

a Unlock call can unblock both a goroutine in the lock or a rlock queue,
but rlock one has prority.
a RUnlock call will unblock a goroutine in lock queue in priroty.


<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    "sync"
    "time"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    m := sync.RWMutex{}
    c := make(chan struct{})
    
    fa := func() {
	    m.Lock()
	    fmt.Println("a")
	    m.Unlock()
    }
    
    fb := func() {
	    time.Sleep(time.Second)
	    m.RLock()
	    fmt.Println("b")
	    <-c
	    m.RUnlock()
    }
    
    fc := func() {
	    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	    m.RLock()
	    fmt.Println("c")
	    c <- struct{}{}
	    m.RUnlock()
    }
    
    m.Lock()
    go fa()
    go fb()
    go fc()
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
    m.Unlock()
    
    select{}
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Not Consider Potential Panics</h3>

should use defer to recover panics and write robust code.

<h3>Not Pay Attention To Too Many Goroutines Created By <code>time.AfterFunc</code></h3>

kind of memory leak, temp

<h3>Use <code>sync.Timer</code> Incorrectly</h3>

sync.Timer, Ticker.Reset

=========================== 

==========================

* make sure every goroutine will not hang for ever
* if a channel will never be closed, be careful when 
  using bare <code><-ch</code> or <code>ch<-v</code> for it.
* if a channel will never be closed, if bare <code>ch<-v</code> is used, 
  make sure the sender will not send more and read all values out of the channel in the end.
* it is recommended to close every channel and read every values out of channels.



<p>
Some princinples:
* know clearly whether a goroutine will exit or not.
  * know clearly how/when a goroutine will exit.
* avoid goroutine exited by unexpected panic.
  * avoid unintended sending data to closed channels.
  * use defer/recover to restart ...
</p>

<p>
Experienced gophers all know that there are three value synchronization techniques: 
mutex, atomic and channel. 
Mutex and atomic are often used in object property getter and setter methods. 
Althought the usage of mutex is simple, but it is not easy to use it without any mistakes.
</p>

<p>
<i>(All pointer values are assumed not nil in this article.)</i>
</p>

<div>
Let's start with the most simplest mistake: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T struct {
	sync.RWMutex
	a, b int // b is just for examples
}

func (t T) AB() int {
	// here t is a copy of T value, 
	// so t.RWMutex is also a copy.
	// W
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
The mistake is that mutex values should not be copied, which is stated in Go spec clearly.
</div>

<div>
Ok, let's change the mutex field into a pointer one: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T struct {
	*sync.RWMutex
	a, b int
}


func (t T) AB() int {
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
This above example is verified by govet, but the synchronization in AB method is totally meaningless. 
Even if the passed receiver is a singleton, the synchronization is still meaningless.
The reason is, although t.a is synchronized, but t itself is not synchronized. 
This can be easily proved by the following simple program: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "sync"
import "time"
import "log"

type T struct {
	*sync.RWMutex
	a, b int
}

func (t T) AB() int {
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	if t.a != t.b {
		log.Fatalln("a != b") // very possible exit here.
	}
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	time.Sleep(time.Microsecond)
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	const NLoops = 100
	var wg = sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(NLoops + NLoops)
	
	var t = T{&sync.RWMutex{}, 0, 0}
	
	for i := range [NLoops]struct{}{} {
		go func(i int) {
			t.SetAB(i)
			wg.Done()
		}(i)
	}
	
	for range [NLoops]struct{}{} {
		go func() {
			t.AB()
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	
	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
So we should always define synchronization methods on pointer types 
instead of non-pointer types: 
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T struct {
	sync.RWMutex
	a, b int
}

func (t *T) AB() int {
	t.RLock()
	defer t.RUnlock()
	return t.a
}

func (t *T) SetAB(ab int) {
	t.Lock()
	t.a = ab
	t.b = ab
	t.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
Done? Partially.
