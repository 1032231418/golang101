<h2>An Introduction Of Go</h2>

<p>
Go is a strong typed and static programming language born from Google research.
Many of the core Go design and SDK development team members have many years
of experience in the field of programming language research.
</p>

<div>
Go has many features, some are unique, some are borrowed from other programming languages:
<ul>
<li>
	built-in concurrent programming support.
	<ul>
	<li>
		goroutines (green threads) and easy to start new goroutines.
	</li>
	<li>
		channels (based on CSP model) and select mechanisms to synchronize data among goroutines.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	built-in map and slice container types.
</li>
<li>
	polymorphism through interfaces.
</li>
<li>
	value boxing and reflection through interfaces.
</li>
<li>
	pointer.
</li>
<li>
	closure.
</li>
<li>
	method.
</li>
<li>
	deferred function calls.
</li>
<li>
	type embedding.
</li>
<li>
	type and memory safe.
</li>
<li>
	automatic garbage collection.
</li>
<li>
	type inference.
</li>
</ul>

Besides above features,
<ul>
<li>
	Go syntax set is deliberately designed simple, clean,
	and similar to other popular programming languages.
	This makes Go code written by one programmer easily understood by others.
</li>
<li>
	Go has many great built-in standard packages which implement all kinds of
	common functionalities. Most of the packages are cross-platform.
</li>
<li>
	Go also has an active community, there are
	<a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go">plenty of
	high quality third party Go packages and projects</a> to import and use. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All these combined together make programming in Go efficient and enjoyable.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In fact, although Go is a static strong typed programming language,
Go also have many features generally only belong to dynamic languages.
Generally, it is hard to combine the two in one language. But Go did it.
In other words, Go has both the precision of static strong typed languages
and the flexibility of dynamic languages.
I can't say there is not any compromises between the two,
but the effect of the compromises is much weaker than the benefit of the combination in Go.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the most popular Go compiler is maintained by Go design team.
Later we will call it the official Go compiler, or <code>gc</code>
(an abbreviation for Go compiler, not for garbage collection).
Go design team also maintains another Go compiler, <code>gccgo</code>,
which is used less popular than <code>gc</code>.
The two compilers are still in active development.
But Go team focuses more on <code>gc</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>gc</code> is a part of the official Go SDK project.
<code>gccgo</code> is a part of the gcc project.
</p>

<p>
There are many improvements for <code>gc</code> from version to version (two versions each year).
For example, noticeable lags caused by running garbage collections is a common
criticism for languages with automatic memory management.
But since v1.8, the improvements on the concurrent garbage collection implementation
in <code>gc</code> has made the lag problem basically eliminated.
</p>

<p>
One of the advantages of <code>gc</code> it compiles Go programs very fast.
In fact, the current version of <code>gc</code> has not been fully optimized yet. It could be faster.
Compilation time is an important factor for the happiness of local development.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage of <code>gc</code> is it supports cross-platform compilation.
For example, we can build a Windows executable on Linux OS, and vice versa.
</p>

<div>
The output Go executables have following advantages in running
(or some goals of developing <code>gc</code>):
<ul>
<li>
	small memory footprint.
</li>
<li>
	fast code execution.
</li>
<li>
	short warm-up duration, so great deployment experience.
</li>
</ul>

Some other compiled languages, such as C/C++/Rust also have the three advantages,
but they are lack of the two important advantges of Go:
<ul>
<li>
	short compilation duration, so rapid development iterations and happy local development experience.
</li>
<li>
	flexible like dynamic langauges.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
All above six advantages combined makes Go an unique language and a good choice for many projects.
Currently, Go is popularly used in network, system tools and database development areas.
But there are also more and more game, big data and AI projects starting to use Go.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Go is not perfect in all aspects. There are many trade-offs in Go design.
And Go really has some shortcomings currently.
For example, Go doesn't support generic for custom types and function now.
But Go team members are not against generic in Go,
they just haven't found a good solution to keep Go clean and simple yet.
Go is still active development. Nothing is impossible in the future.
