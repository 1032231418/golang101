<h1>An Introduction Of Go</h1>

<p>
Go is a compiled and statically typed programming language born from Google.
Many of the core Go design and SDK development team members have many years
of experience in the field of programming language research.
</p>

<div>
Go has many features, some are unique, some are borrowed from other programming languages:
<ul>
<li>
	built-in concurrent programming support.
	<ul>
	<li>
		goroutines (green threads) and easy to start new goroutines.
	</li>
	<li>
		channels (based on CSP model) and select mechanisms to do synchronizations among goroutines.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	built-in map and slice container types.
</li>
<li>
	polymorphism through interfaces.
</li>
<li>
	value boxing and reflection through interfaces.
</li>
<li>
	pointer.
</li>
<li>
	closure.
</li>
<li>
	method.
</li>
<li>
	deferred function calls.
</li>
<li>
	type embedding.
</li>
<li>
	type and memory safe.
</li>
<li>
	automatic garbage collection.
</li>
<li>
	type deduction.
</li>
</ul>

Besides above features,
<ul>
<li>
	Go syntax set is deliberately designed simple, clean,
	and similar to other popular programming languages.
	This makes Go programming easy to pick up and makes
	the Go code written by one programmer easy to understand by others.
</li>
<li>
	Go has many great built-in standard packages which provide all kinds of
	common functionalities. Most of the packages are cross-platform.
</li>
<li>
	Go also has an active community, there are
	<a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go">plenty of
	high quality third party Go packages and projects</a> to import and use.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>
Go programmers are often called gophers.
</p>

<p>
In fact, although Go is a compiled and static typed programming language,
Go also have many features which generally are only available for dynamic script languages.
It is hard to combine the two in one language. But Go did it.
In other words, Go owns both the strictness of static languages
and the flexibility of dynamic languages.
I can't say there are not any compromises between the two,
but the effect of the compromises is much weaker than the benefit of the combination in Go.
</p>

<p>
Readability is an important factor which affects the design of Go heavily.
From the syntax viewport, it is not hard for one gopher to understand
the Go code written by another gopher.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the most popular Go compiler is maintained by Go design team.
Later we will call it the official Go compiler, or <code>gc</code>
(an abbreviation for Go compiler, not for garbage collection).
Go design team also maintains another Go compiler, <code>gccgo</code>,
which is used less popular than <code>gc</code>.
The two compilers are still in active development.
But Go team focuses more on the development of <code>gc</code>.
<code>gc</code> is a part of the official Go SDK.
<code>gccgo</code> is a part of the gcc project.
</p>

<p>
There are many improvements for <code>gc</code> from version to version (two versions each year).
For example, noticeable lags caused by garbage collecting is a common
criticism for languages with automatic memory management.
But since Go 1.8, the improvements made for the concurrent garbage collection implementation
in <code>gc</code> have made the lag problem basically eliminated.
</p>

<p>
One of the advantages of <code>gc</code> is it compiles Go programs very fast.
In fact, the current version of <code>gc</code> has not been fully optimized yet.
It could be faster.
Compilation time is an important factor for the happiness in development.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage of <code>gc</code> is it supports cross-platform compilation.
For example, we can build a Windows executable on a Linux OS, and vice versa.
</p>

<div>
The output Go executables have the following advantages in running:
<ul>
<li>
	small memory footprint.
</li>
<li>
	fast code execution.
</li>
<li>
	short warm-up duration (so great deployment experience).
</li>
</ul>

Some other compiled languages, such as C/C++/Rust also have the three advantages,
but they are lack of the two important advantges of Go
(though they have their respective advantages over Go):
<ul>
<li>
	short compilation duration, so happy local development experience
	and short deployment iteration cycles.
</li>
<li>
	flexible like dynamic langauges.
</li>
<li>
	built-in concurrent programming supports.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
All the above advantages combined makes Go become an unique language
and a good choice for many kinds of projects.
Currently, Go is popularly used in network, system tools,
database development and block chain development areas.
But there are also more and more game, big data and AI projects starting to use Go.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Go is not perfect in all aspects.
There are many trade-offs in Go design.
And Go really has some shortcomings currently.
For example, Go doesn't support generic for custom types and function now.
But Go team members are not against custom generic in Go,
they just haven't found a good solution to keep Go clean and simple yet.
Go is a language still in evolving and in active development.
Nothing is impossible in the future.
