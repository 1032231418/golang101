
<p>
Although Go absorbs many features from all kinds of other languages,
Go is often viewed as a C family language.
Same as C, Go also supports struct and pointer types.
This article will introduce the basic kwowledges of struct types in Go.
</p>

<h3>Struct Types And Their Literals</h3>

<div>
Each unnamed struct type literal starts with a <code>struct</code> keyword
which is following by a sequence of variable declarations enclosed in a <code>{}</code>.
These variable declarations are a variant of the standard variable declaration form
by omitting the <code>var</code> keyword.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title  string
	author string
	pages  int
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Each of the declared variables is called a field of the struct type.
Some articles also call fields as member variables.
The number of fields in a struct type can be zero.
</p>

Multiple field declarations can be place in the same line,
seperated by using the code line terminators (<code>;</code>),
such as
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title string; author string; pages int
}
</code></pre>
<p>
But the above coding style is not recommended to use in Go.
</p>

Consecutive fields with the same type can be declared together.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}
</code></pre>

Each struct field can be bound with a tag when it is declared.
Field tags are optional, the default value of field tags are blank strings.
Here is an example showing non-default filed tags.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	Title  string `json:"title"`
	Author string `json:"author,omitempty"`
	Pages  int    `json:"pages,omitempty"`
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The purpose of specified field tags is application dependent.
In the above example, the filed tags can help the functions in the
<code>encoding/json</code> standard package to determine the field names in JSON texts,
when encoding struct values into JSON texts or decoding JSON texts into struct values.
The functions in the <code>encoding/json</code> standard package will
only encode and decode the exported struct fields, which is why
the first letters of the field names in the above example are all upper cased.
If the field tags are not specified, then the corresponding field names in JSON texts
will be same as the field names in code.
</p>

<p><i>
(BTW, the <code>omitempty</code> word in a field tag means the field can be absent
from the JSON texts if the value of the field is a zero value.)
</i></p>

<p>
Please don't use field tags as comments.
</p>

<p>
Raw string literals (<code>`...`</code>) are used more popular than
interpreted string literals (<code>"..."</code>) for field tags in practice.
</p>

<p>
Only exported fields of exported struct types declared in a package
are visible to the external of the package.
</p>

The order of the field declaraions and field tags matter for a struct type.
Two unnamed struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, 
and if corresponding fields have the same names, and identical types, and identical tags. 
Non-exported field names from different packages are always different.
In other words, two unnamed struct types are two distinct types even if they have
the same set of field declarations but if any of the following ones is true
<ul>
<li>
	the field declaration orders are different.
</li>
<li>
	at least one pair of the field tags are different.
</li>
<li>
	the two struct types are from two different package and
	at least one name of their fields starts with a lower cased letter.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All above shown struct types are unnamed, or called anonymous struct types.
In practice, named (defined) struct types are used more popular.
A defined struct type has the same field set as the source struct type.
</p>

<p>
A field of struct type <code>S</code> may be also of another struct type.
All the fields of the struct field can be called indirect fields of type <code>S</code>.
None fields, either direct ones or indirect ones,
of type <code>S</code> can the of type <code>S</code>.
</p>

<p>
Unlike C language, Go structs don't support union.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Struct Value Literals And Struct Value Manipulations</h3>

<div>
Given a struct type <code>S</code>, its value can be used composite literals to represent.
Assume type <code>S</code> has two fields, <code>x int</code> and <code>y bool</code> in order,
then the zero values of <code>S</code> can be represented by the following
two variants of struct composite literal forms:
<ul>
<li>
	<code>S{0, false}</code>.
	In this form, none field names are present but all filed values must be present
	by the field declaration order.
</li>
<li>
	<code>S{x: 0, y: false}, S{y: false, x: 0}, S{x: 0}, S{y: false} and S{}</code>.
	In this form, each field is optional to be present.
	The values of the absent fields are zero values of their corresponding types.
	But if a field is present, it must be with the <code>FieldName: FieldValue</code> form.
	The order of the fields in this form doesn't matter.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a value <code>v</code> of type <code>S</code>, we can use
<code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code>, which are called selectors,
to access the field values of <code>v</code>.
</p>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Book struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}

func main() {
	book := Book{"Go 101", "Tapir", 256}
	fmt.Println(book.pages) // 256
	
	book = Book{title: "Go 101"}
	book.author = "Tapir"
	book.pages = 256

	// Initialize a struct value without
	// using composite literals.
	var book2 Book // <=> book2 := Book{}
	book2.title = "Go 202"
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>About Struct Value Assignments</h3>

<div>
When a struct value is assigned to another sturct value,
the effect is the same as assigning each field one by one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Book struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}

func main() {
	book1 := Book{pages: 300}
	book2 := Book{"Go 101", "Tapir", 256}
	
	book2 = book1
	// <=>
	/*
	book2.title = book1.title
	book2.author = book1.author
	book2.pages = book1.pages
	*/
	
	fmt.Println(book2) // {  300}

</code></pre>

<p>
Two struct values can be assigned to each other only if
the types of two struct values must have the identical underlying type (considering field tags)
and at least one of the struct types must be an unnamed type.
</p>
</div>

<h3>About Struct Value Conversions</h3>

<p>
In Go, if a value <code>v</code> can be converted to type <code>T</code>,
then the conversion can be represented with <code>(T)(v)</code>,
in particular, if <code>T</code> is an identifier, it can be simplified as <code>T(v)</code>.
</p>

<div>
A struct value of type <code>S1</code> can be converted to another struct type <code>S2</code>
if <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> share the identical underlying type (ignoring field tags),
in particular if either <code>S1</code> or <code>S2</code> is an unnamed type
and they underlying types are identical (considering struct tags),
then the struct value can be implicitly converted to type <code>S2</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

type S0 struct {
	y int "foo"
	x bool
}

type S1 struct {
	x int "foo"
	y bool
}

type S2 struct {
	x int "bar"
	y bool
}

type S3 struct {
	x int "bar"
	y bool
}

func main() {
	v0, v1, v2, v3 := S0{}, S1{}, S2{}, S3{}
	v4 := struct {
		x int "bar"
		y bool
	}{}
	
	// None of the conversions are legal,
	// for field names don't match.
	/*
	_, _, _ = S1(v0), S2(v0), S3(v0) // 
	
	*/
	
	// The two conversions must be explicit,
	// for the two involved types are both named.
	var _ S3 = S3(v2)
	var _ S2 = S2(v3)
	
	// The two conversions must be explicit,
	// for field tags are not the same.
	var _ S2 = S2(v1)
	var _ S1 = S1(v2)
	var _ S1 = S1(v4)
	
	// These conversions can be implicit.
	var _ S3 = v4
	var _ struct {
		x int "bar"
		y bool
	} = v3
	
	// All local variables must be used at least once.
	_ = v0
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Pointers To Struct Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
The article <a href="pointer.html">Pointers in Go</a> explains pointers in detail.
If you haven't got what are pointers yet, please read that article firstly, then go back here.
</p>

<p>
If a struct value is addressable, then all of its fields are also addressable.
</p>

For a pointer <code>p</code> of struct value <code>v</code> which has field called <code>x</code>,
we can use <code>p.x</code> as a shorthand of <code>(*p).x</code> to access the <code>x</code> field.
Different from C language, there is not the <code>-&gt;</code> operator in Go.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		title, author string
		pages         int
	}
	
	var book Book
	pbook := &book
	pbook.title = "Go 101"
	
	// This is a sugar to create a struct pointer.
	pbook = &Book{author: "Tapir"}
	pbook.pages = 256
}
</code></pre>

todo: named pointer types selector rules.

</div>
