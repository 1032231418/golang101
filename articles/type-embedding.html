

<p>
From <a href="struct.html">this article</a>, we know that a struct type can have many fields.
Each of the fields is composed of one field name and one field type.
In fact, sometimes, a struct field can only be composed of one field type.
Such fields are called anonymous fields in Go.
An anonymous field is also called a type embedding.
</p>

<p>
This article will explain the intention of type embedding and all kinds of details in type embeddding.
</p>

<h3>What Does Type Embedding Look Like?</h3>

<div>
Here is an example of type embedding:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type P = *int
	var x struct {
		string // a defined non-pointer type
		error  // a defined interface type
		*int   // an unnamed pointer type
		P      // an alias of an unnamed pointer type
	}
	x.string = "Go"
	x.error = nil
	x.int = new(int)
	x.P = new(int)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, three types are embedded in the struct type.
Each type embedding forms an anonymous field.
</p>

In fact, each anonymous field has an implicit name.
The names of the three anonymous fields are
<code>string</code>, <code>int</code> and <code>error</code>, correspondingly.
</div>

<h3>Which Types Can be Embedded?</h3>

<div>
Following types can be embedded in struct types.
<ol>
<li>
	Any named type which is not a pointer type (but can be an interface type).
	The named types can be alias of unnamed types.
</li>
<li>
	Any unamed pointer type which base type must be a named type,
	and the named base type must be neither a pointer type nor an interface type.
</li>
<li>
	The aliases of the unamed pointer types described in the second case.
</li>
</ol>

Following lists some types can and can't be embedded:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Encoder interface {Encode([]byte) []byte}
type Person struct {name string; age int}
type Alias = struct {name string; age int}
type AliasPtr = *struct {name string; age int}
type IntPtr *int

// These types can be embedded in a struct type.
Encoder
Person
*Person
Alias
*Alias
AliasPtr
int
*int

// These types can't be embedded.
*Encoder
*AliasPtr
IntPtr
*IntPtr
struct {name string; age int}
map[string]int
[]int64
func()
</code></pre>

As the last section mentioned, each anonymous field has an implicit name.
The name of an anonymous field is
<ul>
<li>
	the name of the field type, which is embedded, if the field type is a named type.
</li>
<li>
	the base name of the field type if the field type is an unnamed pointer type.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
No two fields are allowed to have the same name in a struct,
there are not exceptions for annonymous struct fields.
By the anonymous field implicitly naming rules,
an unnamed pointer type can't be embedded along with its base type
in the same struct type.
For example, <code>int</code> and <code>*int</code> can't be embedded
in a struct type at the same time.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Generally, it is only meaningful to embed types who have fields or methods.
The following section will explain why.
</p>

<h3>What Is The Meaningfulness Of Type Embedding?</h3>

<p>
The main purpose of type embedding is to extend the functionalities of the embedded types
into the embedding type, so that we don't need to reimplement
the functionalities of the embeded types for the embedding type.
</p>

<div>
Many other object-oriented programming languages use inheritance
to achieve the same goal of type embedding.
Both mechanisms have their own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">benefits and drawbacks</a>.
Here, this article will not discuss which one is better.
We should just know Go chose the type embedding mechanism,
and there is a big difference between the two:
<ul>
<li>
	If a type <code>T</code> inherits another type,
	then type <code>T</code> obtains the abilities of the other type.
	At the same time, each value of type <code>T</code> can also be
	viewed as a value of the other type.
</li>
<li>
	If a type <code>T</code> embeds another type,
	then type other type becomes a part of type <code>T</code>,
	and type <code>T</code> obtains the abilities of the other type,
	but none values of type <code>T</code> can be viewed as values of the other type.
</li>
</ul>

Here is an example to show how an embedding type extends the functionalities of the embedded types.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "strings"

type Person struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

func (p Person) PrintInfo() {
	fmt.Println("Name:", p.name)
	fmt.Println("Age:", p.age)
}

func (p *Person) UpdateInfo(name string, age int) {
	p.name = name
	p.age = age
}

type Singer struct {
	Person // extends Person by embedding it
	works []string
}

func (s Singer) ListWorks() {
	fmt.Println("Works:", strings.Join(s.works, ", "))
}

func main() {
	var gaga Singer
	gaga.works = []string{"The Fame", "Poker Face"}
	gaga.ListWorks()

	// A Singer value acts as a Person value.
	gaga.name = "Lady Gaga"
	gaga.age = 30
	gaga.PrintInfo()
	
	// But a Singer value is not a Person value.
	// The following two lines don't compile.
	/*
	var person Person
	person = gaga
	*/
	
	// A *Singer value acts as both a Person and a *Person value.
	gagaPointer := &gaga
	gagaPointer.UpdateInfo("Gaga", 31)
	gagaPointer.PrintInfo()
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output">
Works: The Fame, Poker Face
Name: Lady Gaga
Age: 31
</pre>
</div>

<p>
From the above example, it looks that after embedding type <code>Person</code>,
the type <code>Singer</code> owns all methods and fields that type <code>Person</code> has,
and type <code>*Singer</code> owns all methods that either type <code>Person</code> or
type <code>*Person</code> has.
</p>

<p>
Are the conclusions right? The following sections will answer this question.
</p>

<h3>Does The Embedding Type Obtain The Fields Of The Embedded Types?</h3>

<div>
Let's list all the fields of type <code>Singer</code> in the last example by using reflection
functionalities provided by the <code>reflect</code> standard package:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	t := reflect.TypeOf(Singer{})
	fmt.Println(t, "has", t.NumField(), "fields:")
	for i := 0; i < t.NumField(); i++ {
		fmt.Print("   filed#", i, ": ", t.Field(i).Name, "\n")
	}
</code></pre>

The result:
<pre class="output">
main.Singer has 2 fields:
   filed#0: Person
   filed#1: songs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
From the result, we know that the type <code>Singer</code> owns neither
a <code>name</code> field nor a <code>age</code> field.
Then why are the expressions <code>gaga.name</code> and <code>gaga.age</code>
legal for a <code>Singer</code> value <code>gaga</code>?
Please read the next section to get the reason.
</p>

<h3>Shorthands Of Selectors</h3>

<p>
In Go, for a value <code>x</code>, <code>x.y</code> is called a selector of <code>x</code>,
where <code>y</code> is either a field or a method.
If <code>y</code> is a field, then <code>x</code> must be a stuct value or a struct pointer value.
A selector is an expresssion, which represents a value.
The value <code>x.y</code> may also has its own selectors.
So a selector may contain more than two tokens, such as <code>x.y.z</code>.
</p>

<p>
There is a syntax sugar in Go, <b><i>if a middle token in a seletor
corresponds an anonymous field, then that token can be omitted from the selector</i></b>,
except that the selector collides or is shadowed by other selectors
(please read the following sections for what are selector colliding and shadowing).
</p>

<div>
For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type A struct {
	x int
}
func (a A) MethodA() {}

type B struct {
	A
}

type C struct {
	B
}

func main() {
	var c C
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	fmt.Println(c.B.A.x)
	fmt.Println(c.B.x)
	fmt.Println(c.A.x)
	fmt.Println(c.x)
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	c.B.A.MethodA()
	c.B.MethodA()
	c.A.MethodA()
	c.MethodA()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This is why the expressions <code>gaga.name</code> and <code>gaga.age</code> are legal.
They are just the shorthands of <code>gaga.Person.name</code> and <code>gaga.Person.age</code>.
</p>

As any embedding type must be a struct type,
the article <a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a>
has mentioned that the field of an addressable struct value
can be accessed through the pointers of the struct value.
So the following code is also legal in Go.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func main() {
	var c C
	pc = &c
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	fmt.Println(pc.B.A.x)
	fmt.Println(pc.B.x)
	fmt.Println(pc.A.x)
	fmt.Println(pc.x)
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	pc.B.A.MethodA()
	pc.B.MethodA()
	pc.A.MethodA()
	pc.MethodA()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Similiarly, 
<ul>
<li>
	method <code>gaga.PrintInfo</code> can be viewed as
	a shorthand of <code>gaga.Person.PrintInfo</code>.
</li>
<li>
	method <code>gagaPointer.UpdateInfo</code> can be viewed as
	a shorthand of <code>(&gaga.Person).UpdateInfo</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, it is also okay if we think they aren't shorthands.
Please read the next section for details.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Does The Embedding Type Obtain The Methods Of The Embedded Types?</h3>

<div>
Again, let's list all the methods of type <code>Singer</code> by using reflection:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func PrintTypeMethods(t reflect.Type) {
	fmt.Println(t, "has", t.NumMethod(), "methods:")
	for i := 0; i < t.NumMethod(); i++ {
		fmt.Print("   method#", i, ": ", t.Method(i).Name, "\n")
	}
}

func main() {
	PrintTypeMethods(reflect.TypeOf(Singer{}))
	fmt.Println()
	PrintTypeMethods(reflect.TypeOf(&Singer{}))
}
</code></pre>

The result:
<pre class="output">
main.Singer has 2 methods:
   method#0: ListWorks
   method#1: PrintInfo

*main.Singer has 3 methods:
   method#0: ListWorks
   method#1: PrintInfo
   method#2: UpdateInfo
</pre>

<p>
From the result, we can find that the type <code>Singer</code> really
has a <code>PrintInfo</code> method,
and the type <code>*Singer</code> really
has a <code>PrintInfo</code> and an <code>UpdateInfo</code> method.
This is why we can think expression <code>gaga.PrintInfo</code> is not
a shorthand of <code>gaga.Person.PrintInfo</code>
and expression <code>gagaPointer.UpdateInfo</code> is not
a shorthand of <code>(&gaga.Person).UpdateInfo</code>.
</p>

<p>
In fact, for each method of an embedded type, if it neither collides nor is shadowed
by other methods and fields (please read the following sections for details),
then compiler will implicitly declare a correspoding method for the embedding struct type,
and consequently, compiler will also <a href="method.html#implicit-pointer-methods">implicitly declare
a correspoding method</a> for the unnamed pointer type whose base type is the embedding struct type.
</p>

Here are the implicitly declared methods for type <code>Singer</code> and <code>*Singer</code>
and their corresponding implicitly declared functions:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (s Singer) PrintInfo() {
	s.Person.PrintInfo()
}

func (s *Singer) PrintInfo() {
	(*s).Person.PrintInfo()
}
</code></pre>

Beside above mentioned implicitly declared methods and functions,
for each method of the pointer type whose base type is an embedded type,
if it neither collides nor is shadowed by other methods and fields,
then compiler will implicitly declare a correspoding method for
the unnamed pointer type whose base type is the embedding struct type.
So here is the other implicitly declared method for type <code>*Singer</code>:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (s *Singer) UpdateInfo(name string, age int) {
	(&s.Person).UpdateInfo(name, age)
	// <=> (&(*s).Person).UpdateInfo(name, age)
	// <=> s.Person.UpdateInfo(name, age)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
So for the three methods of type <code>*Singer</code>, two of them
(<code>PrintInfo</code> and <code>UpdateInfo</code>) are obtained through type embedding.
The third one <code>ListWorks</code> is a <a href="method.html#implicit-pointer-methods">consequence</a>
of that type <code>Singer</code> has a corresponding method.
</p>

Simply speaking, 
<ul>
<li>
	both type <code>struct{T}</code> and <code>*struct{T}</code>
	will obtain (inherit) all the methods of type <code>T</code>.
</li>
<li>
	type <code>*struct{T}</code> will obtain (inherit)
	all the methods of type <code>*T</code> as well.
</li>
<li>
	both type <code>struct{*T}</code> and <code>*struct{*T}</code>
	will obtain (inherit) all the methods of type <code>*T</code>.
	As the method set of type <code>T</code> is a subset of type <code>*T</code>,
	we can also say both type <code>struct{*T}</code> and <code>*struct{*T}</code>
	will obtain (inherit) all the methods of type <code>T</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a type embedding,
if the embedded type implements some interface types,
then the embedding type will also implement these inrerface types
if the embedding types obtains all the methods specified in the interface types
from the embedding type.
</p>

<p>
From the article <a href="method.html">methods in Go</a>,
we know that we can't explicitly declare methods for unnamed struct types
and unnamed pointer types whose base types are unnamed struct types.
But through type embedding, such types can also own methods.
</p>

Here is another example to show which implicit methods are declared.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "reflect"

type F func(int) bool
func (f F) Validate(n int) bool {
	return f(n)
}
func (f *F) Modify(f2 F) {
	*f = f2
}

type B bool
func (b B) IsTrue() bool {
	return bool(b)
}
func (pb *B) Invert() {
	*pb = !*pb
}

type I interface {
	Load()
	Save()
}

func main() {
	PrintTypeMethods := func(t reflect.Type) {
		fmt.Println(t, "has", t.NumMethod(), "methods:")
		for i := 0; i < t.NumMethod(); i++ {
			fmt.Print("   method#", i, ": ", t.Method(i).Name, "\n")
		}
	}
	
	var s struct {
		F
		*B
		I
	}
	
	PrintTypeMethods(reflect.TypeOf(s))
	fmt.Println()
	PrintTypeMethods(reflect.TypeOf(&s))
}
</code></pre>

The result:
<pre class="output">
struct { main.F; *main.B; main.I } has 5 methods:
   method#0: Invert
   method#1: IsTrue
   method#2: Load
   method#3: Save
   method#4: Validate

*struct { main.F; *main.B; main.I } has 6 methods:
   method#0: Invert
   method#1: IsTrue
   method#2: Load
   method#3: Modify
   method#4: Save
   method#5: Validate
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Selector Shadowing And Colliding</h3>

<p>
The number of dots in the full form of a selector can be called the depth of the selector.
For example, if <code>x.y.z</code> is a full form selector, then its depth is 2.
</p>

<div>
Sometimes, for a value <code>x</code>, there may be multiple selectors whose last tokens are identical. 
Assume the last tokens are <code>y</code>, among these selectors,
<ul>
<li>
	if only one selector has the smallest depth, then the only one selector can be
	shortened to <code>x.y</code> (or one-dot selector), whereas the others can't.
	We can say the others are shadowed by the one with the smallest depth.
</li>
<li>
	if more than one selectors have the smallest depth, then none of them can be
	shortened to <code>x.y</code>.
	We can say the selectors with with the smallest depth are collided.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a method selector with depth larger than one can't be shortened to an one-dot selector,
then there will not be implicit methods declared for the corresponding method.
</p>

For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type A struct {
	x string
}
func (A) y(int) bool {
	return false
}

type B struct {
	y bool
}
func (B) x(string) {}

type C struct {
	B
}

// v1.A.x and v1.B.x are collided,
// so both of them can't be shortened to v1.x.
// v1.A.y and v1.B.y are also collided.
// so both of them can't be shortened to v1.y.
// No implicit methods are declared for the type of v1.
var v1 struct {
	A
	B
}

// v2.C.x is shadowed by v2.A.x, so v2.x <=> v2.A.x.
// v2.C.y is shadowed by v2.A.y, so v2.y <=> v2.A.y.
// Only one implicit method is declared for the type of v2,
// the method name is y.
var v2 struct {
	A
	C
}

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", v2.x) // string
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", v2.y) // func(int) bool

	// The following two lines don't compile.
	/*
	_ = v1.x
	_ = v1.y
	*/
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Interface Types Embed Interface Types</h3>

<p>
Not only can struct types embed other types, but also interface types can.
But interface types can only embed named interface types.
Please read <a href="interface.html#embedding">interfaces in Go</a> for details.
</p>

<h3>A Defined Type Will Only Obtain Methods Which Are Obtained Through Embedding From The Source Type</h3>

<p>
In a type definition, if the new defined type is neither an interface type nor a pointer type,
then for each method, which is obtained through type embedding, of the source type,
a corresponding method with the same name will be implictly declared by compiler for the new defined type.
The methods which are not obtained (by the source type) through type embedding
will not be obtained by the new defined type.
</p>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type MyInt int
func (mi MyInt) IsOdd() bool {
	return mi%2 == 1
}

// Type S has two methods, IsOdd and Scale.
// IsOdd is obtained through embedding MyInt.
type S struct {
	MyInt
}
func (s S) Scale(n int) int {
	return int(s.MyInt) * n
}

// Type T only obtains the IsOdd method from S.
// It doesn't obtain the Scale method from S.
type T S

func main() {
	var t T = T{5}
	
	// This line compiles okay.
	fmt.Println(t.IsOdd()) // true
	
	// This line doesn't compile.
	/*
	fmt.Println(t.Scale(12))
	*/
}
</code></pre>

</div>
