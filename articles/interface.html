<p>
Interface types are one special kind of types in Go.
Interface kind plays several important roles in Go.
Firstly, interface types make Go support value boxing.
Consequently, through value boxing, reflection and polymorphism get supported by Go.
</p>

<p>
Before explaining what is value boxing, we need to understand some concepts.
</p>

<h3>What Are Methed Sets?</h3>

<p>
A method set is a collection of method signatures.
A method signature is composed of a method name and a function signature.
A function signature is a parameter declaration list
plus a return result declaration list.
Parameter and result names are not important for a function signature.
</p>

<p>
Please note, non-exported method names, which start with lower-case letters,
from different packages will be viewed as two different method names.
</p>

<p>
The order of the method signatures in a method set is not important for the method set.
</p>

<div>
Some examples of method signarutes:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">About() string
DoFilte([]int) []int
IsEqualTo(Comparable) bool // Comparable is a custom type.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>What Are Interface Types?</h3>

<p>
Each interface type specifies a collection of method signatures.
In other words, each interface type defines as a method set.
For any of the method signature specified by an interface type,
its name can't be the blank identifier <code>_</code>.
</p>

<div>
Some examples of interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// This is an unnamed interface type.
interface {
	About() string
}

// ReadWriter is a named interface type.
type ReadWriter interface {
	Read(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
	Write(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
}

// Comparable is also a named interface type.
type Comparable interface {
	IsEqualTo(another Comparable) bool
}
</code></pre>

Please note that the <code>error</code> result type in the method signatures
declared by the <code>ReadWriter</code> type is
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#error">a built-in interface type</a>.
It is decalred as
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type error interface {
        Error() string
}
</code></pre>

In particular, an interface type with a blank collection of method signatures
is called blank interface type. Some blank interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// An unnamed blank interface type.
interface{}

// Type I is a named blank interface type.
type I interface{}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>The Method Set Of A Type</h3>

<div>
Each type has a method set associated with it.
<ul>
<li>
	For an interface type, its method set is the method signature collection it declared.
</li>
<li>
	For a non-interface type, its method set is the signature collection of
	all the methods defined, either explicitly or implicitly, for the non-interface type.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><i>
(About methods of non-interface types, please read
<a href="method.html">methods in Go</a> and
<a href="type-embedding.html">type embedding</a>.)
</i></p>

<p>
For convenience, the method set of a type is often also called
the method set of any value of the type.
</p>

<p>
Two unnamed interface types are identical if they have the method set.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="implementation"></p>
<h3>What Are Implementations?</h3>

<p>
If the method set of an arbrtrary type <code>T</code>, <code>T</code> may be an interface type or not,
is a super set of the method set of an interface type <code>I</code>,
then we say type <code>T</code> implements interface <code>I</code>.
</p>

<p>
Implementations are all implicit in Go.
The implementation relations are not needed to be specified for compiler in code explicitly.
There is no <code>implements</code> keyword or alike syntax in Go.
Go compiler will check the implementation relations automaticlly as needed.
</p>

<p>
An interface type implements itself.
Two interface types with the same method set implement each other.
</p>

<div>
For example, in the following example, the method sets of
stuct pointer type <code>*Book</code>, integer type <code>MyInt</code> and
pointer type <code>*MyInt</code> are all <code>{About() string}</code>,
so they all implement the above mentioned
inteface type <code>interface {About() string}</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Book struct {
	name string
	// more other fileds ...
}

func (book *Book) About() string {
	return "Book: " + book.name
}

type MyInt int

func (MyInt) About() string {
	return "I'm a custom integer value"
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
As any method set is a super set of a blank method set,
so any type implements any blank interface types.
This is an important fact in Go.
</div>

<h3>Value Boxing</h3>

<p>
OK, let's come to the main points now.
</p>

<div>
In Go, when a type <code>T</code> implements an interface type <code>I</code>,
then a value of type <code>T</code> can be converted to type <code>I</code>.
<ul>
<li>
	If type <code>T</code> is a non-interface type, then
	the result of the conversion is a copy of the <code>T</code> value is
	boxed (or encapsulated) into a value of type <code>I</code>.
	The time complexity of the copy is <code>O(n)</code>,
	where <code>n</code> is the size of copied interface value.
</li>
<li>
	If type <code>T</code> is an interface type, then the result of
	the conversion is a copy of the value boxed in the <code>T</code> value is
	boxed (or encapsulated) into a value of type <code>I</code>.
	The official Go compiler makes an optimazation here,
	so the time complexity of for most such copy actions are <code>O(1)</code>,
	instead of <code>O(n)</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
When a value is boxed in an interface value, the value is called
the <b><i>dynamic value</i></b> of the interface value.
The type of the dynamic value is called the
<b><i>dynamic type</i></b> of the interface value.
</p>

<p>
The dynamic value of an interface value must be a non-interface value,
and it is immutable.
</p>

<p>
In Go, the zero values of any interface type are represented by <code>nil</code> literally.
Nothing is boxed in <code>nil</code> interface values.
Assign <code>nil</code> to an interface value will clear the dynamic value
boxed in the interface value.
</p>

<p><i>
(NOTE: the zero values of many non-interface types in Go
are also represented by <code>nil</code> in Go.
Non-interface <code>nil</code> values can also be boxed in interface values.
Such interface values are not <code>nil</code> interface values.)
</i></p>

<p>
As any type implements any blank interface types,
so any non-interface value can be boxed in a blank interface value.
</p>

<div>
Generally, value boxings happen in value assignments with interface values as the destinations.
In any of such assignments, the source value type must implement the destination interface type.
The consersions don't need to be explicit in such assignments.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Aboutable interface {
	About() string
}

// *Book implements Aboutable
type Book struct {
	name string
}
func (book *Book) About() string {
	return "Book: " + book.name
}

func main() {
	// Any non-interface value can be boxed into
	// a blank interface value.
	var i interface{}
	i = []int{}
	i = map[string]int{}
	i = true
	i = 1
	i = "abc"
	fmt.Println(i) // abc
	
	// The fmt.Println function accepts arguments
	// of type interface{}.
	
	// A *Book value is boxed into a Writer value.
	var a Aboutable = &Book{"Go 101"}
	fmt.Println(a) // &{Go 101}
	
	// Box the value in an interface value into
	// another interface value.
	i = a

	// Clear the boxed value in interface value i.
	i = nil
}
</code></pre>
<p><i>
(NOTE: the parameters of the <code>fmt.Println</code> function are all of 
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Println">the blank interface type <code>interface{}</code></a>.
This means any value can be passed to the <code>fmt.Println</code> function as arguments.
Every of the arguments will be converted to <code>interface{}</code> type.)
</i></p>
</div>

<div>
Information of the dynamic type is also boxed in (more accureately, referenced by)
the interface value. The dynamic type information is essential
for implementing two features in Go.
<ol>
<li>
	The dynamic type information includes a method slice table
	which storages all the corresponding methods declared by the interface type
	and defined for the dynamic type of the interface type.
	This table is the key of implementing <a href="#polymorphism">polymorphisms</a> in Go.
</li>
<li>
	The dynamic type information also includes all sorts of other information
	about the dynamic type, such as
	what <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#Kind">kind</a> the dynamic type is
	and the method list and field list of the dynamic type, etc.
	The information is the key of implementing <a href="#reflection">reflection</a> in Go.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
At run time, all type information is stored in a global zone.
Each interface value just holds a reference to one type information item.
Each non-interface to interface type implementation relation corresponds
to one global method table.
The method tables will only be created as needed.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="polymorphism"></p>
<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

<p>
Polymorphism is one key functionality provided by interfaces,
and it is an important feature of Go.
</p>

<p>
When a non-interface value <code>t</code> of a type <code>T</code>
is boxed in an interface value <code>i</code> of type <code>I</code>,
call a method declared by the interface type <code>I</code>
on the interface value <code>i</code>
will call the corresponding method defined for the non-interface type <code>T</code>
on the non-interface value <code>t</code> acctually.
In other words, call method <code>i.m</code> will call method <code>t.m</code> acctually.
With different values boxed into the interface value,
the interface value behaves differently.
This is called polymorphism.
</p>

<p>
The method table stored in an interface value is a slice.
Mehtod lookup in the table is just a slice element indexing.
</p>

<p><i>
(NOTE: call methods on a <code>nil</code> interface value will panic at run time,
for there are no available defined methods can be called.)
</i></p>

<div>
An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Filter interface {
	About() string
	Process([]int) []int
}

// A UniqueFilter will remove duplicated numbers.
type UniqueFilter struct{}
func (UniqueFilter) About() string {
	return "remove diplicated numbers"
}
func (UniqueFilter) Process(inputs []int) []int {
	var outs = make([]int, 0, len(inputs))
	var pusheds = make(map[int]bool)
	for _, n := range inputs {
		if !pusheds[n] {
			pusheds[n] = true
			outs = append(outs, n)
		}
	}
	return outs
}

// A MultipleFilter will only keep numbers which are
// multiples of the MultipleFilter as an integer.
type MultipleFilter int
func (mf MultipleFilter) About() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("keep multiples of %d", mf)
}
func (mf MultipleFilter) Process(inputs []int) []int {
	var outs = make([]int, 0, len(inputs))
	for _, n := range inputs {
		if n % int(mf) == 0 {
			outs = append(outs, n)
		}
	}
	return outs
}

// With the help of polymorphism, only one "filteAndPrint"
// function is needed.
func filteAndPrint(fltr Filter, unfiltered []int) []int {
	// Call the methods of "fltr" will call the methods
	// of the value boxed in "fltr" acctually.
	filtered := fltr.Process(unfiltered)
	fmt.Println(fltr.About() + ":\n\t", filtered)
	return filtered
}

func main() {
	numbers := []int{12, 7, 21, 12, 12, 26, 25, 21, 30}
	fmt.Println("before filtering:\n\t", numbers)
	
	// Three non-interface values are boxed into three Filter
	// interface slice element values.
	filters := []Filter{
		UniqueFilter{},
		MultipleFilter(2),
		MultipleFilter(3),
	}

	// Each slice element will be assigned to the local variable
	// "fltr" (of interface type Filter) one by one. The value
	// boxed in each element will also be copied to "fltr".
	for _, fltr := range filters {
		numbers = filteAndPrint(fltr, numbers)
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output">
before filtering:
	 [12 7 21 12 12 26 25 21 30]
remove diplicated numbers:
	 [12 7 21 26 25 30]
keep multiples of 2:
	 [12 26 30]
keep multiples of 3:
	 [12 30]
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, polymorphism makes it is unnecessary to
write one <code>filteAndPrint</code> function for each filter types.
</p>

<p>
Besides the above benifit, polymorphism also makes it possible for
package developers to write exported functions and methods which
accept any user defined types, as long as the user types implement the
interface types of the parameters of the exported functions and methods.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In fact, polymorphism is not an essential feature.
There are alternative ways to achieve the same job,
such as callback functions.
But the polymorphism way is cleaner and more elegent.
(In fact, polymorphism can be viewed as a high level of callback mechanism.)
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="reflection"></p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
The dynamic type information storages in an interface value
can be used to inspect and manipulate the dynamic value which is boxed in the interface value.
This is called reflection in programming.
The method sets declared by interface types and
the method table stored in interface values are not used in reflection.
</p>

<p>
Currently (v1.9), Go doesn't support generic for custom functions and types.
Reflection partially remedies the inconveniences caused by lacking of generic.
</p>

<p>
This article will not explain the functionalities provided by
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/">the <code>reflect</code> standard package</a>.
Please read <a href="reflection.html">Reflections In Go</a> to get how to use this package.
Below will only introduce the built-in reflection functionalities in Go.
In Go, built-in reflections are achieved with type assertion and type switch.
</p>

<h4>Type Assertion</h4>

<div>
There are four kinds of interface value involved value conversions in Go:
<ol>
<li>
	convert non-interface value to interface value, where the type of the non-interface value
	must implement the type of the interface value.
</li>
<li>
	convert interface value to interface value, where the type of the source interface value
	must implement the type of the destination interface value.
</li>
<li>
	convert interface value to non-interface value, where the type of the non-interface value
	may or may not implement the type of the interface value.
</li>
<li>
	convert interface value to interface value, where the type of the destination interface value
	may or may not implement the type of the source interface value.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Above has explained the first two.
The two both require the source value type must implement the destination interface type.
The convertibility for the first two are verified at compile time.
</p>

<p>
Here will explain the later two.
The convertibility for the later two are verified and acieved at run time,
by using a syntax called <b><i>type assertion</i></b>.
In fact, the syntax also applies to the second kind of conversions.
</p>

The form of type assertion expression is <code>i.(T)</code>,
where <code>i</code> is an interface value and <code>T</code> is
<ul>
<li>
	either a non-interface type which must implement the type of <code>i</code>
</li>
<li>
	or an arbrtrary interface type.
</li>
</ul>

In a type assertion <code>i.(T)</code>,
<code>i</code> is called the asserted value and <code>T</code> is called asserted type.
A type assertion would succeed or fail.
<ul>
<li>
	If <code>T</code> is a non-interface type, then the intention of the type assertions is
	to get the dynamic values boxed in an interface value.
	<code>T</code> must be the dynamic type of <code>i</code> to make the assertion succeed.
	Each of such cases can be viewed as a value unboxing attempt.
</li>
<li>
	If <code>T</code> is an interface type, then the intention of the type assertions is
	to make the dynamic value boxed in an interface value also boxed in another interface value.
	The dynamic value of <code>i</code> must be convertible to interface type <code>T</code>
	to make the assertion succeed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each type assersion can return two values.
The first one is required and the second one is optional.
The second optional return result is a boolean value,
which indicates whether a type assersion succeeded or not.
The type of the first return retult is always <code>T</code>.
If a type assersion failed, the first return retult must be
a zero value of <code>T</code>.
</p>

Therer are three cases when performing a type assertions:
<ol>
<li>
	the assertion succeeded. For this case,
	the first return value is the dynamic value boxed in the interface value,
	and the second optional bool return value is <code>false</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the assertion failed and the second bool return result is present.
	For this case, the second bool return value is <code>false</code>,
	and the first return value is a zero value of type <code>T</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the assertion failed and the second bool return result is absent.
	For this case, the type assertion will cause a panic.
</li>
</ol>

An example (<code>T</code> is a non-interface type):
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Compiler will deduce the type of 123 as int.
	var x interface{} = 123
	
	// Case 1:
	n, ok := x.(int)
	fmt.Println(n, ok) // 123 true
	n = x.(int)
	fmt.Println(n) // 123
	
	// Case 2:
	a, ok := x.(float64)
	fmt.Println(a, ok) // 0 false
	
	// Case 3:
	a = x.(float64) // Will panic.
}
</code></pre>

Another example (<code>T</code> is an interface type):
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Writer interface {
	Write(buf []byte) (int, error)
}

type DummyWriter struct{}
func (DummyWriter) Write(buf []byte) (int, error) {
	return len(buf), nil
}

func main() {
	var x interface{} = DummyWriter{}
	var y interface{} = "abc" // dynamic type is string.
	var w Writer
	var ok bool
	
	// DummyWriter implements both Writer and interface{}.
	w, ok = x.(Writer)
	fmt.Println(w, ok) // {} true
	x, ok = w.(interface{})
	fmt.Println(x, ok) // {} true
	
	// The dynamic type of y is string, which doesn't
	// implement Writer.
	w, ok = y.(Writer)
	fmt.Println(w, ok) // &ltnil&gt; false
	w = y.(Writer) // Will panic.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In fact, the method call of <code>i.m(...)</code> on an interface value <code>i</code>
which dynamic type is <code>T</code> is equivalent to the method call of <code>i.(T).m(...)</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<h4>Type Switch</h4>

<p>
The type swtich syntax may be the weirdest syntax in Go.
It can be viewed as the enhanced version of type assertion.
</p>

<p>
In a type swtich block,
the <code>case</code> keywords can be followed by
<code>nil</code> identifier, type names and type literals.
These following items can't appear multiple times in the same type swtich block.
An optional <code>default</code> branch is also allowed.
</p>

<div>
Here is an example of type switch:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	values := []interface{}{
		456, "abc", true, 0.33, int32(789),
		[]int{1, 2, 3}, map[int]bool{}, nil,
	}
	for _, x := range values {
		// Here, v is declared once, but it denote
		// different varialbes in different branches.
		switch v := x.(type) {
		case []int: // type literal
			// The type of v is []int.
			fmt.Println("int slice:", v)
		case string: // one type name
			// The type of v is string.
			fmt.Println("string:", v)
		case int, float64, int32: // multiple type names
			// The type of v is always same as x.
			// In this example, it is interface{}.
			fmt.Println("number:", v)
		case nil:
			// The type of v is always same as x.
			// In this example, it is interface{}.
			fmt.Println(v)
		default:
			// The type of v is always same as x.
			// In this example, it is interface{}.
			fmt.Println("others:", v)
		}
		// NOTE, each variable denoted by v in the
		// last three branches is a copy of x.
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output">
number: 456
string: abc
others: true
number: 0.33
number: 789
int slice: [1 2 3]
others: map[]
&lt;nil&gt;
</pre>

The above example is equalenvent to the following one:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	values := []interface{}{
		456, "abc", true, 0.33, int32(789),
		[]int{1, 2, 3}, map[int]bool{}, nil,
	}
	for _, x := range values {
		if v, ok := x.([]int); ok {
			fmt.Println("int slice:", v)
		} else if v, ok := x.(string); ok {
			fmt.Println("string:", v)
		} else if x == nil {
			v := x
			fmt.Println(v)
		} else {
			_, isInt := x.(int)
			_, isFloat64 := x.(float64)
			_, isInt32 := x.(int32)
			if isInt || isFloat64 || isInt32 {
				v := x
				fmt.Println("number:", v)
			} else {
				v := x
				fmt.Println("others:", v)
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><i>
(Note, <code>fallthrough</code> statement can't be used in the <code>case</code> branch blocks
of a type swtich block.)
</i></p>

<div>
Some details about type switch:
<ul>
<li>
	the assertion return value following the <code>switch</code> keyword
	can be ignored if we don't care about it (<code>swtich x.(type) {...}</code>).
</li>
<li>
	unlike general type assertions, the type assertion following
	the <code>switch</code> keyword can return most one value.
	The form <code>swtich v, ok := x.(type) {...}</code> is illegal.
</li>
<li>
	like general switch blocks,
	between the <code>switch</code> keyword and the assertion,
	a simple statement is allowed to be present.
	For example, <code>switch x := f(); v := x.(type) {...}</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the form <code>switch v := v.(type) {...}</code> is common used in Go programming.
	Here, the first <code>v</code> is a new declared variable in the type switch
	code block, it shadows the second <code>v</code>, which is an interface variable
	declared before entering the type switch code block.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>More About Interfaces In Go</h3>

<p class="anchor" id="embedding"></p>
<h4>Interface Type Embedding</h4>

<div>
In Go, an interface type can embed another named interface type.
The final effect is the same as unfolding the method signarutes
specified by the embedded interface type into definition body of
the embedding interface type.
For example, given the following two named interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Ia interface {
	fa()
}

type Ib interface {
	fb()
}
</code></pre>

then the following interface type:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">interface {
	Ia
	Ib
}
</code></pre>

has the identical method set as <code>Ic</code>:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Ic interface {
	fa()
	fb()
}
</code></pre>

Up to now (Go 1.9), if two interface types both have a method declaration with the same name,
then they can't be embedded as the same time in other interface types,
even if the two same name methods have the same signature.
For example, the following two interafce types are both illegal:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">interface {
	Ia
	Ic
}

interface {
	Ib
	Ic
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="comparison"></p>
<h4>Interface Values Involved Comparisons</h4>

<div>
There are two cases of interface values involved comparisons:
<ol>
<li>
	comparisons between a non-interface value and an interface value.
</li>
<li>
	comparisons between two interface values.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For the first case,
the type of the non-interface value must implement the type of the interface value,
so the non-interface value can be converted to (boxed into) an interface value.
This means a comparison between a non-interface value and an interface value
can be translated to a comparison between two interface values.
So below only comparisons between two interface values will be explained.
</p>

The steps of comparing two interface values (with the <code>==</code> operator).
<ol>
<li>
	If one of two interface values is a <code>nil</code> interface value,
	then the comparison result is whether or not the other intrface value is also a <code>nil</code> interface value.
</li>
<li>
	If the dynamic types of the two interface values are two different types,
	then the comparison result is false.
</li>
<li>
	For the case of the dynamic types of the two interface values are the same type,
	<ul>
	<li>
		if the same dynamic type is an
		<a href="conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html#comparison-rules">incomparable type</a>,
		then panic.
	</li>
	<li>
		otherwise, the comparing result is the result of comparing the dynamic values of the two interface values.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b, c interface{} = "abc", 123, "a"+"b"+"c"
	fmt.Println(a == b) // a case for step 3. Print "false".
	fmt.Println(a == c) // a case for step 3. Print "true".
	
	var s []int = nil // []int is not a comparable type
	var i interface{} = s

	fmt.Println(i == nil) // a case for step 1. Print "false".
	fmt.Println(i == i)   // a case for step 2. Will panic.
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>The Internal Structure Of Interface Values</h4>

<p>
For the offcial Go compiler/runtime, blank interface values and non-blank interface values
are represented with two different internal structures.
Please read <a href="underlying-values.html#interface-structure">Underlying Values in Go</a>
for details.
</p>

<h4>Pointer Dynamic Value vs. Non-Pointer Dynamic Value</h4>

<p>
The offcial Go compiler/runtime makes an optimization
which makes than boxing pointer values in interface values
is more efficient than boxing non-pointer values.
For <a href="value-copy-cost.html">small sized values</a>,
the efficiency difference is small,
but for large sized values, the difference may be not small.
For the same optimization, type assertions with a pointer type
are also more efficient than type assertions with the base type
of the pointer type if the base type is a large sized type.
</p>

<p>
So please try to avoid boxing large sized values, box their pointers instead.
</p>

<p><i>
(BTW, for the official Go compiler and runtime,
types other than array and struct types are all small sized types.
Struct types with very few fields are also small sized.)
</i></p>

<h4>Values Of <code>[]T</code> Can't Be Directly Converted To <code>[]I</code>
	Even If Type <code>T</code> Implements Interface Type<code>I</code>.</h4>

<div>
For exampel, sometimes, we may need to concert a <code>[]string</code> value
to <code>[]interface</code> type. Unlike some other languages, there is no
direct ways to make the conversion. We must make the conversion manually in a loop:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

// The signature of fmt.Println function is
// func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error).
// So a []string argument can't be passed to it.

func main() {
	words := []string{
		"Go", "is", "a", "high",
		"efficient", "language.",
	}
	// fmt.Println(words...) // not compile

	// Convert []string value to []interface{}.
	var iw []interface{}
	for _, w := range words {
		iw = append(iw, w)
	}
	fmt.Println(iw...) // compiles okay
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<!---



should try to avoid to box large-size values. assignments will copy the boxed values.

http://commaok.xyz/post/interface-allocs

since Go1.5, in the official compiler implementation (), if the dynamic value
is not a pointer, the runtime will alloc memory for a copy of the danymic value and 
storage the pointers of the copy in the interface value.


need a special article: the underlying structures of blank interface and non-blank interface.
